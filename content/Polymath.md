# Polymath

Turns out, it's not about math. It's someone who has advanced (ish) knowledge in a wide variety of subjects. The benefit of this generalization (as opposed to the [[Illusion of Specialization]]) is that you can connect ideas (via [[Combinational Creativity]]) across a multitude of subjects. 
Note: Not exactly the same as a [[Renaissance Man]] â€” they have more applicable abilities, rather than knowledge.
