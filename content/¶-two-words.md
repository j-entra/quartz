Idea: The best way to sell to, brand, persuade, or inspire people is to condense your idea down to **Two Words**.

- See: [Atomicity](Atomicity.md)

Examples:
1. [Purple Cow](purple-cow.md)
2. Think Different â€” [Apple](apple.md)
3. [Infinite Games](infinite-games.md)

- What about One Word ideas? Too vague.
	- Good example: Obama's Hope campaign.
- MVP = MVC (Minimum Viable Concept)
- Formulas:
	- differentiating factor + important word = you, in a nutshell
		- Atomic Habits
	- [verb] your [noun]
		- Atomize your ideas.


Thoughts: Names are two words (usually.), Names representing individuals, individuals containing multitudes (of inspiration, pain, memories).
I thought Ideas had to be two sentences. Maybe I'll condense everything.
