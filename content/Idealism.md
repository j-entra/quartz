# Platonic Idealism

## Concepts
[[Allegory of the Cave]]
[[Theory of Ideas]]
[[Constitution]]
[[Hyperuranion]]


> Objects of thought are our true reality.

Mathematics is a good example of this concept. The perfect form of a square is not ■. This is simply a collection of pixels. Idealism asks "What is more real": A "physical" square, or the idea of a square? [[Plato]] argues that the idea of a square is more real — it will pass all definitions of a square more-so than the square on the screen. 

The idea or mental representation of the square is known as a [[Form]]. [[Forms]] are real. [[Physical Realm]] is only an attempt at a reflection of higher truth, divided by the [[Analogy of the Divided Line]]. Higher truth is abstraction, it is unchanging ideas. These ideas all live in [[Hyperuranion]].

## Physical Realm 
No matter what we look at (a horse, a square), our mind perceives the abstract, perfect [[Form]].
