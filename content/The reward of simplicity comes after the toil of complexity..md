# [Notes](https://www.swyx.io/simplicity-rush/):
"I draw same conclusion as you though. Can't "skip" the middle. But not because it's some "love the journey" thing or "the accomplishment is the journey", but rather because you **just can't tell people stuff**. They have to feel it themselves. [[Apprenticeship]] matters.

To me simplicity is made more beautiful when understood through a long personal struggle with complexity. When I can dance with it, having turned a mighty nemesis into an old friend, and teach others to do the same.

Better to have loved _and_ lost, than never to have loved at all.""
