one chronic, dehabilitating struggle of mine was perfectionism. 
wasted motion and wasted non-motion.

instead of perfecting the product, perfect the process. just like with [systems](fall-to-systems.md) over goals, it is the process that you must channel your energy into. it is the journey, not the destination. 

instead of putting your all into an essay that you won't even care about a month later, figure out how to find the most optimized, efficient way to go about your task that will give you the quality that you have decided on.

decided is the key word: you must figure out what's important to you and only you. do not waste your time and efforts on anything more. succeed with no wasted motion. 

life is short, focus on what's important.
