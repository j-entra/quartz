**Atom:** i recently got into fountain pens........

**current pen collection:**
1. [hongdian bent nib](https://www.amazon.com/Brushed-Calligraphy-Fountain-Converter-Hongdian/dp/B07Y8MJBT9): bought for urban sketching. writing with it is a little messy, but the line variation and the depth you get with this pen!!!!!!
2. [twsbi eco clear m ](https://www.amazon.com/TWSBI-ECO-Fountain-Pen-Clear/dp/B01EINFPNQ/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=twsbi+eco+fountain+pen&qid=1653865038&s=office-products&sprefix=tws%2Coffice-products%2C141&sr=1-1): a little thicker than desired, and skips when i want to hold it at a certain angle to get better line variation between the up and down strokes. ): but!!! beautiful body, kind of thick but still good for an EDC pen. 

**up next:**
- looking for good EF to F nib next!
