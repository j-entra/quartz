atom:
you can position your product based on price and perceived value.  positions 6-8 are not competitive, and if we find ourselves in these positions, we should lower the price or increase perceived value.

apparently, [porters generic strategies](porters-generic-strategies.md) sux! so Bowman and Faulkner expanded the three initial positions to eight by focusing on value proposition.

1. **low price, low value**
	1. think dollar tree. this position relies on volume to sustain business. it's not too competitive, and your product lacks differentiation and perceived value.
	2. **low price**
		1. think jetblue. companies here often rely on economies of scale, and there is perceived value (as opposed to position 1). can result in price wars. 
	3. **hybrid (moderate price/moderate differentiation)**
		1. ikea. effective if a company can articulate added value, consistent quality, and some product differentiation. 
	4. **differentiation**
		1. apple. max level of perceieved value, a unique value that you can only get from the company. product quality and branding will usually play a huge role.
	5. **focused differentiation**
		1. luxury. positioning at high price levels, but its okay because there's high perceived value. 
	6. **risky high margins**
		1. a short term strategy (not sustainable long-term) used to exploit temporary market supply disequilibrium. toilet paper???? ps5??
	7. **monopoly pricing**
		1. windows, back in the day. kinda illegal
	8. **loss of market share**
		1. apple pushing blackberry smart phones out. this happens when products have low percieved value, but high pricing.
