**Atom:** I will track my time for an entire month, in order to see where my time and priorities lie. 


## Catalyst: 
- Working a 9-5 is great in the sense that it keeps you busy, feeling useful, giving you a sense of purpose. But a recurring source of pain comes from the fact that I don't have complete control of my time, not consciously anyways. I'm constantly feeling like I'm wasting my time, no matter if I'm resting (which is good for recovery) or working (feeling as if I'm not working fast enough). No matter what I do, I can't help but feel guilt about what I choose to do, minute by minute. It feels like time is passing by, and if I blink, I'll be another year older with nothing to remember, nothing to show for it, nothing to be proud of, nothing to say: "This is a goal that I have set, and achieved."

##  Benefits:
- This is why I'm going to track my time and ensure that my hours are going to things that I actually want to do. It serves as a double-edge sword: 
	- reassures me that I'm doing things that I actually want to do, that I'm consciously putting effort forth. This is because I have to write out the task before I track it. If I'm doing something for myself, I won't mind if I spend a little longer than I would like to do it. As long as I'm doing it. (Not the same for actual work — that is still optimized through [parkinsons-law](parkinsons-law) and [pareto's principle](pareto-principle.md).
	- It reassures me that time spent resting and recovering are useful as well, because they are planned.

## Technical Goal:
- My goal is track my time for an entire month. I'll be using Toggl, since it seems like the quickest way to capture data.

## Emotional Goal:
- To have a healthier and happier work-life balance. 
- To put time towards my personal goals and hobbies (creation), rather than recovering by consumption.
- To not feel guilt and anxiety about how I spend my time. 

## Timeline: 
*Start: Sunday, Oct 24th — End: Sunday, Nov 30th*
- Week 1: Capture time as is, without restrictions on time. 
- Week 2: Figure out recurring tasks, and automate them using iOS shortcuts or Keyboard Maestro
- Week 3: Again, look at recurring tasks, and optimize a weekly schedule. Test out schedule.
- End of Day: Review day. Approve day, or figure out what sections could be improved 1% for the next day.
- End of Week: Review week, note down sections. Approve or Improve. 


## Potential Blockers:
1. This is reactive, not proactive. If I wanted to maximize my time, I should be planning it out, not tracking it. 
	- Counterargument: This is simply the awareness stage. I need to be aware of where I spend my time as it is.
