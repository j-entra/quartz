The world is yours, if you want. The fruit of the universe, ripe with all the sweetness of life. To be made by you, to be consumed by you.

We will never be satiated enough. Gluttony until we consume the universe. The hand is based off of the creation of Adam, the apple the story about Eve. The food being the solar system, which is a more concrete representation fo the universe. The action is us, reaching for everything, wanting to devour. The rings make up a fruit bowl, based of the @monday challenge of the week. Grand but mundane. Whichever way you want to interpret. 

Wanted to go in three color directions, realistic, dreamscape, and red/blue. Red/blue is most limiting, and this constraint will allow for more freedom in ideas.

If I had more time, I would figure out that grapes situation. it distracts from the two main elements.
