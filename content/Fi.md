# Introverted [[Feeling]] (Fi) - "Authenticity"

- For the INTJ, the Fi helps them empathize with others. INTJs can be cold and distant until Fi develops. Then they might become more sensitive to other's feelings. The INTJ might even want to spend time helping people, either by coaching, or volunteer work. Something that was unthinkable in the INTJs early life.

- If they are uncomfortable with this softer side of themselves, they will probably ignore it, which can lead to ruthless and cold behavior towards even those they care about. TeNi’s should be wary if they have a tendency to ignore their morality and emotions.  
	
- Their morals are decided without too much influence from others, although they will take their experiences with others into account.

- Ultimately, they value their own opinion the most. If they believe they are doing the right thing, they will be able to rationalize almost anything.
	
- "outward demeanor is harmonious, inconspicuous, giving an impression of pleasing repose" but she will be **secretive** and prone to melancholy. [[Still waters run deep]]
	
- While prone to be affected intensely by things, she remains inaccessible and hard to understand. She will be sympathetic to others and listen but with "**no desire to affect others,** to impress, influence or change them in any way." **In the worst scenario she may become moody and sullen; festering in her own feelings**. And if she is extroverted, she is prone to aggression, accusation and hysteria.
