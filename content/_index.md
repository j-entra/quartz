# About


ðŸ‘‹  Hello! I'm Jen, and these are my notes. 

Iâ€™m a generally private person, but this is me [working with the garage door up.](Work-with-the-garage-door-up.md) Where to poke around? Maybe my [workbench,](workbench.md) or maybe my [bookshelf.](library.md)

Disclaimer: I'm currently transferring all of my notes from Obsidian formatting to one that will play nice with Quartz. That's why everything's so brutal and broken.  Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯


This site was built by [Jacky Zhao](https://jzhao.xyz/) using [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) (with some tweaks). If you're wondering what *exactly* this is, [here's a good article](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/) on digital gardens.
