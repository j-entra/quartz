# Free Energy Principle

If you are alive, what sorts of behaviors *must* you show?

The story goes as such: [[The Second Law of Thermodynamics]] says that the [[Universe]] is moving towards chaos.

As living things, we resist this entropy. 

Free energy is the difference between the states you expect to be in and the states your sensors tell you that you are in. Or, to put it another way, when you are minimizing free energy, you are minimizing _surprise_.

Helps explain [[Mental Illness]]: the brain assigns incorrect merit to [[Sensation]]. To put mental illness in oversimplified terms, it's "just broken beliefs or false inference". 
- False according to who? Reality? Is reality even all that reliable? (I think this favoritism towards [[Surrealism]] over [[Nature of Reality]] might be a broken belief.)

Free energy principle as it relates to [[Evolution]] (more so [[Active Inference]]) â€” oh wait, someone's already thought of it.
