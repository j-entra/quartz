vuca stands for volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity as it refers to the world. 

## volatility 
volatile means fluctuation, change, unstability. prices, opinions, trends can change from one day to the next. no matter how much we plan, we are often faced with unexpected realities. if we rely on outdated information, slow feedback loops, and are adverse to risk or change, than we will fall behind. to account for volatility, make sure you have [optionality](optionality.md), are [antifragile](antifragile.md), and rely on the most up to date [first principles thinking.](first-principles-thinking.md)

## uncertainty
uncertainty comes when you have a lack of information. make sure that you are exchanging all information, and collecting as many voices as possible. at a certain point however, you will realize you cannot collect and analyze all the information that you seek. just make a decision, and update accordingly (if you can)

## complexity
complexity means the effects of actions cannot be calculated in advance, the if-then principle will not apply. actions can have unintended consequences, for better or worse. 
complicated is not the same as complex. complicated situations can be simplified to first principles. 
do not try to prematurely establish relationships between cause and effect [aposteriori.](aposteriori.md) simplify your core operations so that you have a clear view of desired target and can address potential issues easily. 

## ambiguity
ambiguity refers to the quality of being open to more than on interpretation. linear and cause and effect explanations are not always black and white. there can be many right answers.
