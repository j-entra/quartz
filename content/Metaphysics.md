# Metaphysics

Defined as abstract theory with no basis in reality. Doesn't actually have to do much with physics, but named "ta meta ta phusika": one should master [[Physics]] first. 

In the past, there were three definitions regarding the subject matter: [[Being as Such]], [[First Causes]], [[Unchanging Things]]. It's now regarded as a non-issue. 

### [[Peter van Inwagen]]'s 3 Questions of Metaphysics
1. What are the most general features of the world? What things does it contain? What is the World like?
2. Why does a World exist — and more specifically, why is there a World having the features and the content described?
3. What is our place in the world? How do we human beings fit into it?

Theme 1: [[First Causes]]
Theme 2: [[The Study of Being]]
