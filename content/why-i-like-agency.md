**Atom:** It perfectly fits my personality. 

1. It fulfills my desire to learn and improve upon my skillset. 
2. It's fastpaced, and deadline focused. I can only work when I'm fueled by deadlines.
3. It helps me learn where to optimize my workflows so in the future, I can work even more efficiently. 
4. It helps me visualize clear future trajectories that I have the opportunity to take, such as  ui/ux or [web dev](1-programming.md). 
5. I'm good at designing. If I'm good at it, chances are it'll be easier to reach flow state. If I reach [flow-state](flow-state.md) more often, then I'm more fulfilled.
6. I'm terrible â€” which means that I have a clear path to growth and improvement. 
7. I love the people there. Everyone knows so much. 
8. I struggle with dehabilitating perfectionism.
