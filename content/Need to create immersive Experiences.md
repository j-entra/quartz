**This need comes in many forms.**
- When I look at art in a museum.
- When I went to the PACE gallery.
- My appreciation for aquariums
- My Graphic Design, Motion Design, 3D design, 3D/Motion design pipeline. 
- Creating spirit weeks (Halloween, Valentine's Day) out of want, not necessity.
- The football campaign I cite as my "Why Marketing" answer in interviews. 
- My appreciation for ambiance in music festivals [[Odesza]], coupled with the fact that I like to directly connect with the music and the environment rather than the people around me.
