- design is never done. when you launch a product, it should always be updated and refined to reflect current trends and moods. 
- when i say design, what do i mean? there's design as an action, on making specific decisions about appearance and functionality. but there's also the result of design, which is the end product. 
- it's the same thing. both requires a perfect understanding of your audience, not a perfect process.
