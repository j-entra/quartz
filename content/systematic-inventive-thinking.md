title: "Systematic Inventive Thinking"

[index](/.md) | [thinking](1-thinking.md)

- [40 inventive principles](40-inventive-principles.md) led to [inventive problem solving](inventive-problem-solving.md), which led to SIT.
- Idea: Think inside the box. 
	- Paradigm Shift: All the building blocks for innovation are right there in front of you, and the solution only requires the reorganization of existing elements. 
- Relates to [freedom of constraints](freedom-of-constraints.md), Limitation is a catalyst for creativity.
- Brainstorming needs rules and regulations, a dance between [Convergent Thinking](convergent-thinking.md) and [Divergent Thinking](divergent-thinking.md).
	- Article also relates it to [Parkinson's Law](parkinsons-law.md): ideas expand to fit the box that is provided. Much quicker to limit the scope of possibilities, saving time and energy. Goes against the idea of [creativity](creativity.md), a little. (If I tried hard enough, I'd probably be able to combine the two thought processes.) 

### The Innovation Equation
1. Subtraction
	1. iPhone gets rid of headphone jack -> paves way for Airpod Pros
2. Multiplication
	1. Multiple # of pixels -> Retina Screens
3. Division
	1. Laptop -> tablet
4. Task unification
	1. Alexa listens to you, you listen to it + (added bonus: smart homes, all in one home management system)
5. Attribute Dependency
	1. Break them or create new intentional dependencies
	2. Transition glasses: dark -> glasses; light -> sunglasses
