- everything we do is due to unconscious status signaling. 
- example: i have a kindle reader, but i want to purchase certain physical books to write in and display. the kindle is by far more efficient, so why do i want physical books as decoration?

	- serves as social proof for the corporation, and social proof for you.

	- signal amplification: in software, give people a set of tools to amplify their status or purchase. this is called "proof of work"
	- for example: maplestory hair, neopets paintbrushes
- where do brand evangelists come from?
	- when i use my moleskine to jot down notes, or use my macbook to process my notes, i am choosing to identify with those brands
		- note: i love muji. but muji isn't a brand? nope - it's an anti-brand brand. 
	- in an study, apple users and samsung users were told - + and neutral news about each company....
	- why?
		- brands allow for self expression. we "choose" our identities (or so we think). our identities or the brands we associate with will allow others to form an impression of what we are about (for better or for worse)
		- this is why appearance is so important in culture

		- we seek community! [Sapiens](books/Sapiens.md)
		- brands are pillars of our identity
