- [ want [ goal pool ->] reality]
- everything must be continually updated - your wants, abilities, the reality, etc. to best serve you (preferably in the future)
- reflect frequently to evolve
- package beliefs should be reevaluated.
	- anything that you believe as a result of a tribe (any organizations, psychodemographic, geographical, corporation)
	- what is our identity tied to? is it the people around us, and the corporations? or is our identity tied to ourselves? #on/identity 
	- this is not to say that we shouldn't have an identity -- we should have steadfast principles by which to live by. we have to ensure, however, that these principles are formulated from our conscious pickings. 
	- by holding onto our identity (different from principles), we will never be able to evolve. we will be caught up when we fail, thinking that this aspect is the entirety of us and that we are nothing without our identity. 
	- areas: losing jobs, being unable to do XYZ (running, creating, etc.)
	- when we fail, we become tense because we cannot accept reality as it is. ([stoicism](stoicism.md), [buddhism](buddhism.md))
		- solution: stop expecting. 
	- memory and identity should be removed from important decisions.
		- how much of what happens in the past should we take into account? will we run the risk of making mistakes that we could have easily avoided?
			- no. if X is true, then it will be true unless governed by another circumstance. follow what is fundamentally true at that moment in time. 
			- memory is limiting belief, anyways. 
			- example: lets say we are terrible learners. 
			- memory: the fact that we've failed a course
			- identity: terrible learner
			- what is true? that sentence is not true. what IS true however, lies in the context. 
			- why are we terrible learners? how much time did we put into studying for the test? where did we fail? in comprehension of the material? how is it possible that others comprehended the material and we didn't? is there anything in the world that we cannot access to reach the same level of comprehension?
				- perhaps time. perhaps we have no free slots in our day to study as rigorously as the other. is this true?
				- no -- there is an area right here where i have free time. do other people have less time than me? definitely. so that's not the issue either. 
			- tldr fast forward: to understand material, we need to put in time and effort. others may not need to, but this is true for us. until we update everything. 
	- "old software has been downloaded onto new computers"
	- do not rely on dogma. 


1. [Logic](logic.md)
	1. [Syllogisms](syllogism.md)
	2. ∴ logical truism of two previous propositions *assumed* to be true. In [Math](math.md).
		1. All men are mortal
		2. Socrates is a man.
		3. ∴, Socrates is mortal.
	3. Facts are good, there there are a lot of unknowns as well. Have to supplement with [axioms](axiom.md). These are assumptions that you take to be true, generally well accepted.
