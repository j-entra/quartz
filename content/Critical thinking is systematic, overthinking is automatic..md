# Critical thinking is systematic, overthinking is automatic. 
*"Maybe you weren't thinking critically to begin with? Overthinking isn't even really thinking (in the sense of problem solving)... it's more an automatic thought process, that requires a lack of self reflection to exist. Over thinking is often just a bunch of paranoid thought loops leading into each other going around and round... Critical thinking could help break that loop and you might learn something about yourself in the process." â€” #source/videocomment *

Critical thinking is conscious and deliberate answer-seeking, whereas overthinking generates questions

critical thinking = conscious
- like the conductor

overthinking = not conscious, no power
- like the passenger 

Critical thinking is conscious, overthinking is unconscious. 
manual vs. automatic. 

Everything that people are saying about CT vs. OT talks about anxieties and emotions being the main differentiator. But I don't necessarily want to go down that thought path, because you can have emotions in CT as well. These emotions can be worry, but it's usually desire. If we apply CT to a negative situation, what's the difference? There, you're seeking answers and applying a logical framework (usually). But I can also say critical thinking is thinking outside of the box, so I'm not sure logic is the differentiator either. 

CT = systematic, and controlled
OT: automatic, uncontrolled

**The main thing, is control. Can you control your thinking? If not, then you are overthinking.**

Therefore, control your thinking. You can choose what to think about. That is the difference between critical thinking and overthinking. 

**In more practical terms, critical thinking seeks solutions, whereas overthinking does not aim for a solution. Both are still attempts to understand, but one is driven by your thoughts, and the other is driven by your conscious. **
