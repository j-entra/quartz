## Updates
1. F2F Informational Guide 
2. Had meeting with CalFresh team (Annelyz) to get an overview of what has been done, whats worked, etc.
	1. After this meeting my timeblock is strategy
	2. Presenting ideas on Friday at 9am to Annelyz and Janine and I can forward you the notes after the meeting if you'd like
3. Updated all tasks from Karla on website guide except Collaboration Guide
	1. Currently working on photocards, specifically, establishing logos or icons for programs that do not have it yet (something I realized when creating the F2F informational guide)
		1. I realize that the Website User Interviews project said that they wanted more student representation, but for photocards such as Calfresh right, or Diaper bank, or Social Worker Consultations we don't really have student representation for that so it would be irrelevant to look for it. Even though they are services, they should still have some distinct representation. 
		2. so for example, this was the previous transportation support graphic
			1. it's redundant to have a QR code IF the graphic is displayed on a website, because it means that they're 1. already on our website thru desktop, so they should just click through a button rather than pulling out their phones
			2. same thing with mobile users. 
		3. Logos:
			1. Halal Meat Support
			2. Grocery Card Support
			3. ECRG isn't a logo, it's a graphic so there should be one for that
			4. FRESH Social Worker Consultations
			5. Diaper Bank
		4. Another key issue is readability or accessibility right, and it's kinda of a catch-22 because 1. users requested more photos but by doing so, you make the information hard to scan, it causes strain. 
			1. solutions
				1. All photocards will be presented as such so that photos can co-exist with graphics while still having common elements. this rounded corners principle is taken directly from uci.admissions website, which is the only uci website that looks good 
		5. There's a balancing act that you have to incoporate (friendliness vs. simplicity and accessibility)
		6. However, if you want more vibrancy i can also do photocard illustrations of the different services, so more in line with this
	2. Pages:
		1. Diaper Bank already has a page, have it linked but I'm assuming some content will need to be updated
		2. FAP, needs content
		3.
