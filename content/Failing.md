# Failing

Reading is within my comfort zone. The possibility of being judged by others is not. In fact, this is the reason why I keep quiet on social media. But I haven't linked this to anything. Only a very determined individual will get to explore my corner of the Internet.

By reading, I'm merely pretending that I'm growing. Information in vs. information out - which is more valuable? We can argue that there already is information overload, and I do not need to contribute to this Internet junkyard. But (insert statistic about consumption vs producers). 

My goals with learning in public are as follows (taken from [[private/Anne-Laure-Le-Cunff]]):
1. [[Reframe your perception of possible]]
2. [[Fail like a scientist]]: experiment, lessons learned. 
	1. “The cost of being wrong is less than the cost of doing nothing." — [[Seth-Godin]] #on/failure
