- [[Three.js]] is used (as a framework?)

## Sites
Most of these sites follow one of three formats:
- Scrolldown, with sidetext. These are usually scientific sites, and involve a lot of [[Particle Systems]].

https://airshifumi.hands.agency/# | #game #camera #AI 
> I enjoyed the use of cameras and greater interaction. The story concept was interesting.

https://moooi.com/us/beauty-blooms#hortensia-armchair | #3DDesign
> The graphics used looked like something I could make. The idea is simple. 

https://frontierwithin.thorne.com/ | #on/body 
> This also used cameras, although in a less critical way. Great prompts, made me curious enough to listen with headphones. A good soundscape is key to immersion. Really enjoyed, even fullscreened it. 

https://dogstudio.co/cases/tomorrowland/ | #music/EDM
> Asks how to translate emotions of a real experience (especially something as unique and as "immersive" as a music festival) to the digital landscape. 

https://dogstudio.co/cases/navy-pier/ | #aquarium
> Built with [[Unity3D]]. Physical experience, though. But I like the idea of an aquarium. I'm starting to think [[Game Design]] is a superior field, from the interaction, aesthetics, emotions, skill-building involved, etc. 

> Talks a little about [[Human Behavior]] and it's sources, [[Desire]], [[Emotion]], and [[Knowledge]]. But that's it. Detailed process, but too wordy and not impactful enough.

https://www.oculus.com/medal-of-honor/ | #VR
> Like a roller coaster. Each scroll is controlled, but takes you on a deliberate journey. It's static. I like the implications it has for VR. If I feel this entranced by a simple monitor, I can only imagine how immersive [[Virtual Reality]] will be. I also see stylistic choice with art. Definitely something that the [[Style Transfer]] via [[EbSynth]] would help with. 

https://weedensenteret.no/ | #on/cannabis
> Learned a little about [[Cannabis]]. Had a game, which was cool and all but not that relevant. Could've had a better concept, like...

https://live.vanmoof.com/site | #bikes
> Simple execution. Click and goes to the next element. What I really liked about this site is the excited guy talking about the features. It's personable. 

https://www.aquarium.ru/en | #music #on/psychedelic
> I've come to really enjoy scrolling that takes you through space. Anyways, this is a band — bit misleading name. But great concept, definitely up my alley because it's [[Psychedelic]] and the music's pretty good too. Music starts off muffled, like you're entering a club. Then as you keep scrolling, it's a flurry of visual imagery. Colors remind me of the [[Luminar]] website. 

https://fremtidensuddannelser.dk/en | #on/education
> Great copy, easy to read and understand. Good multimedia approach as well. The navigation was unintuitive, but overall I enjoyed it for it's simplicity and purpose. 

https://turbulent.ca/life/
> The copy is unclear, but I like their [[Three C's of Craftery]]. It's incredible how much good soundscape makes a difference in the experience. 

https://shutdown.gallery/ | [[Art]]
> The idea of a virtual art gallery is appealing to me. I can browse art with more clarity, even if I'm not fully immersed in it. I should explore more virtual art exhibits. It'll allow me to take notes and remember the concepts and meanings behind paintings more. 
> The copy talks about growth and how the pandemic halted it because it blocked or "shut us down". [[Limitation is a catalyst for creativity]].

https://www.merci-michel.com/ | #studio
> They call themselves a digital production house.
	> https://pone.listenanddonate.com/ 
		> Digital eye-tracking software, realistic eye movements. 
	> https://expo.dmlainfo.fr/
		> Riveting put-yourself-in-another-persons-shoes experience. Storytelling is a integral part of these sites. 
	> http://playdoh-lagaleriedesespeces.com/en/
		> I like the visual layout of the museum.
	> http://letsplay.ouigo.com/
		> Pinball machine. Great use of camera movement. Like you are a tiny person within the pinball machine — I think I've wanted that experience before. I've come to realize I enjoy [[Pinball Machines]] as well.
