The Japanese say that you have three faces:

1. The first face, you show to the world.
2. The second face, you show to your close friends and your family.
1. The third face, you never show anyone. It is the truest reflection of who you are.

there's more than these masks. you have the you that you show to your parents, the you to your partner, the you to this organization vs. another, the you to this friend group vs. another. 
digitally, we have different frames on twitter, linkedin, tiktok, instagram. 

in jung's work, these masks are known as [persona](persona.md).

this is not necessarily a bad thing. you do not have to show every single part of yourself to every single person....

goes against [1-MBTI](1-MBTI.md). personalities are fluid â€” i am as much as an introvert as i am an extrovert (also, you have control over your level of intro/extrovertness, openmindedness, whether you're a feeler or a thinker, etc. you just have to #buyintoit.
