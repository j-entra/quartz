## Daily Notes

listening to music high is one of my favorite pastimes. it's temporal. temporally here, only you and you and the music, but temporally somewhere else, like time does not exist but it's okay, you are right here anyways

normalize extra large font sizes. it's an experience in itself, how you take in words. through a movie screen, through a page in a book on a late sunday afternoon.
