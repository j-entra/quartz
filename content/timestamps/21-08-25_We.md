1. Mirror hero's journey
2. Mirror end goal: what people ultimately want to accomplish from service
	1. ex: freedom and comfort of a discreet device, build "trust and self-confidence"
3. A hypothetical example:
	1. no!!!!!!! because they already are. 
	2. ex: NOT "Dealing with acne", but "Kill acne once and for all"
	3. ex: NOT "sell your car today" but "We buy your car in 2 hours"
4. So what does our target user want to hear?
	1. rebuild your self-confidence. Take back your life. 
5. Is there a deadline for pre-orders? how much does it cost to include a countdown timer for loss adversion
