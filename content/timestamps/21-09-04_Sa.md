**Week**: [[21-09-W36]]
**Month**: September | [[21-09_Sep]]
**Year**: [[2021]]

## Daily Notes
My morning routine as it stands is:
1. Wake-up: 10 mins
2. Workout: 30m
3. Shower: 20m
4. Makeup: 30m
5. Reading: 20min
6. Pages: 20mins
7. Change, Pack: 15 min
8. Breakfast: 25min

Total time needed: 2 hrs

Head to work by 8:30am
This means I should be up by 6:30. 

5:30am is fine enough to get the things I want done, if I'm rigorous with it. Test it tomorrow.

That means I have to be in bed by 10, and be asleep by 10:30.
