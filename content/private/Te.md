# Extroverted [thinking](thinking.md) (Te) - "Effectiveness"

Te is the primary way TeNi’s interact with the world around them. Te is all about efficiency and getting things done. It is the TeNi’s primary decision-making process, which means that if a decision is needed in the moment, they will rely on what makes the most sense logically. They are primarily concerned with moving forward and are not interested in wasting time and energy nitpicking a solution to death before applying it. Their solution is the "perfect" solution in the moment. The best, most effective solution is often obvious to them, and they are masters of maximization and efficiency.

- Not only do they value efficiency in their day-to-day decisions, their brain has actually learned how to function with less effort than most.

- They also tend to “focus on goals and are stimulated by task completion and error correction.”
- “they are acutely aware of failures to live up to standards, moral or otherwise.”

- They tend to dislike getting into the dirty details of implementation and are likely to delegate as much as possible to others.

- but it’s important to note that they typically won’t bother correcting someone unless they value that person and/or their work.

- They find debate stimulating and are won over by people who can hold their own in verbal sparring matches.
