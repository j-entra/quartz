When I talk about what made me get into design/[marketing](1-marketing.md), I only talk about creating graphics on [[Neopets]]. But that's not all. 

I've cast away the "[programming](1-programming.md)" (don't think I can really call it programming, or even coding) as an after thought. Why did I make that my story? Why did I not pursue Computer Science as well?

I've had the foray with AP Comp Sci as well. Why didn't I take the time to learn and understand it's implications? Were other things calling my attention? No, I don't think so. Yes, I was busy, but so were a lot of other wildly successful people. Did I not consider myself smart enough to pursue [[Computer Science]]? I think so. 

I didn't appreciate the logical and structured thinking that it entailed. If things were wrong, things would be wrong until you figured out exactly what was needed. The rigidity was not something you could worm your way out of using persuasive tactics. And that [[Persuasion]] is one aspect of [[1-marketing]] that drew me to that path. 

But now, why does this [[creative-code]] call to me? Because at the moment, [[1-marketing]] doesn't *quite* fulfill my [[private/immersive-experiences]]. It's a field previously unknown to me. But now I know.
