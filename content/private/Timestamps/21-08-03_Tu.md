	- Atomic ideas can be:
		- ordered to find multiple narratives
		- grouped non-linear (circle, for loop)
		- spread out everywhere (graph view)
		- book -> ideas (do that for your books)

		- [ ] set aside time to turn all daily notes into distinct atomic notes #todo
			- In an important sense there are no subjects at all; there is only all knowledge, since the cross-connections among the myriad topics of this world simply cannot be divided up neatly. Hypertext at last offers the possibility of representing and exploring it all without carving it up destructively. â€” Ted Nelson #quote/knowledge

Haven't had much time to be self-reflecting these past few days. Everything is so urgent, but I know that this writing habit fuels me and is a dopamine hit in it of itself. 

Everything is a trade-off. Either I'm reading, or I'm creating, or I'm learning, or I'm coding, or I'm working, or I'm socializing, or I'm relaxing and mentally unwinding. I've been sacrificing my physical health as well. I haven't worked out in a while - I suppose I should today.

There are the things I should be doing, which is preparing for installs, making trin's bin, making sure I can buy everything, etc. The reality of life, my social obligations have taken a back seat in pursuit of knowledge. I would say it's good, but I've adopted the framework of moderation, so I can't say that this grind and focus isn't harmful. There needs to be a balance in life, and right now I don't have it. But I'll justify it anyways -- putting in work is always good. 

I've been learning three.js with little foundation recently. It's captivating. I'm filled with a newfound sense of wonder, like a child discovering that amusement parks exist for the first time. The possibilities are now infinite, I could probably do everything that I want to do and more. It's like an addiction, that hit of dopamine after figuring out a new aspect of three.js. In terms of goals, I want to use this skill to scrollytell. Yesterday I did a dive into an awwwards article featuring 30 great websites. One of them stood out to me especially by Mattis Dovier. He uses black and white bit-map art to curate a narrative, complete with music. It was so surreal, the experience. I need perspective, I need soundscape, I need a compelling and thought-provoking narrative to tell. 

Something that differs coding from art (logical, mathematical brain vs. creative side) is the level of actual skill you need. With coding, I can close the gap between what I want and what I can actually output relatively fast. With art however, it's much harder to draw something that doesn't look like shit.

Today will be probably spent sitting in front of the computer, learning more about the fundamentals of three.js. Then, back to JS? React? Not sure. 

const elapsedTime = clock.getElapsedTime()

	if (mouseX > 0) {

particlesMesh.rotation.x = -mouseY * (elapsedTime* 0.00008)

particlesMesh.rotation.y = -mouseX * (elapsedTime* 0.00008)

}
