Subconscious Substack: 
- Questions as tools for thinking:
	- guides you (provides a lens/framework) through your own ideas about the world.

- Self-Organizing Ideas: 
	- [Gall's Law](galls-law.md): simple building blocks produce complexity, complex building blocks are not so simple
		- Lego blocks are good, you can combine them and interlock them with everything. Fit them in like tetris pieces to each new bigger concept. (Atomic Ideas)
	- Evolution of Ideas:
		- The world = your "inner world" (macrocosm to microcosm reflection, per [Jung])
			- ideas: you can frankenstein (mutate) them, make children out of current ideas, prune and cherry-pick [first-principles-thinking](first-principles-thinking.md)
			- therefore, ideas can follow evolution and natural selection (but maybe not as random - is natural selection a free for all?)
	- Creative Oracle:
		- opposite of spaced-repetition tools: programmable attention, convergent thinking (anki)
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTfYv3IEOqM
		- [Daniel Goleman](daniel-goleman.md) on Focus:
			- same author as emotional intelligence
			- somatic markers (gut feeling, base brain)
		- three types of empathy:
			- cognitive empathy
			- emotional empathy
			- empathic concern - lack?
		- exploitation vs. exploration
		- We need inner focus, other focus, and outer focus
