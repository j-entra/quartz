# Introverted [[intuition]] (Ni) - "Perspectives"
- [ ] I cannot tell if I am Ne or Ni. Explore more. #todo
- [ ] I learn through my inner world. 

### Documentation
- Ni is primarily concerned with analysis and thought more for the experience of stretching its own perspectives and predicting possibilities rather than forming firm conclusions. 

- While they like to know where they stand on particular issues, they tend to be comfortable with paradoxes and the unknowable more than other types. 

- Ni is mainly focused either on the future, or things in the present that remain unknown or un-provable (for example: other people’s motives, the true origin of the universe, how will that cliffhanger on their favorite show be resolved).

- TeNi’s have a deep internal world that is often hard for them to put into words or share with others. Ni is their main source of [[Public Garden/FRESH/Books/Creativity - Flow]]. 

- They are very intuitive and can often see all the possibilities for how a particular situation will play out. They are then able to analyze all the options and refine them down until they arrive at what they feel is the most likely one. 

- Their inner world is constantly shifting and changing and analyzing different aspects of things. When they make plans or have a goal in mind, they are naturally able to skip ten steps ahead to see how it might turn out.

- They tend to enjoy work where they get to combine their ability to see ten steps ahead with their drive to make things better and more efficient. [[Strategic Vision]]
