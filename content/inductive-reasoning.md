title: "Inductive Reasoning"
---

As opposed to [Deductive Reasoning](deductive-reasoning.md):
- take specific real world observations (experience) and generalizing them to general truths
	- what about learning from experience?
- induction is not just "all [insert group of people] are [characteristic]", but is prevalent in statistics as well. this leads to a false belief that we are being empirical or data-driven. 
	- counterargument: [Rory Sutherland](rory-sutherland.md) on his talk [The Psychology of Digital [Marketing](marketing.md)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhQRH49Y54k)
		- talks about emotions and how humans *aren't* as logical as we think
		- actually not a counterargument - Sutherland uses it to exploit (harsh word) us, but supporters of [First Principles Thinking](first-principles-thinking.md) use it on themselves.

Atomic Idea: Inductive reasoning is generalization. Beliefs are subjective.
