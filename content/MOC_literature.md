## The Value of a Classical Education 
- source: yt
> become familiar with books like an old friend 
- be more deliberate with what you choose to read. after all, time is finite (for you)

### a classic should:
1. address permanent and universal human concerns
2. be a game changer
3. influence other great works
4. respected by experts 
5. challenging yet rewarding

### Five Values of Reading Classics
1. Value of Forgotten Ideas
2. Value of Connecting Ideas
	1. Ideas derived from classics that have stood the test of time connects us, the reader, with humanity and history. These are fundamental questions that have plagued the human condition across eras, locations, and beliefs. 
3. Value of Strangeness
	1. Goes off #2 - these ideas do not share our current perspective or assumptions. Therefore, these ideas are timeless across bounds.
4. Value of Intellectual Muscle
	1. You don't gain muscle by lifting the same weights. You must progressively overload to unlock a new level of yourself.
5. Value of Better Judgment

### Why should you read classics?
- which is a better use of your time? a book that has stood the test of time throughout centuries, or a book published last week?
	- not too convinced about this. just because a book has stood the test of time does not mean that it is useful in your life, depending on your goals. just because a book was published last week, doesn't mean it can't be a game-changer. the past should not affect your decisions if it does not serve you
	- Counterargument: We are just repeating the classics. 

- Why shouldn't I read articles instead?
	- Articles aren't instructive (disagree). Any amount of time spent on reading a piece of work will have a greater [[ROI]] than an article. it will be higher quality, and you will **discover** rather than learn.
