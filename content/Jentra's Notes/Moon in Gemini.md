# Moon in Gemini

Accordingly, you may find that you have an innate need to know as much as possible about the world around you, and may have a talent for numbers, speech or the written word.

**Gemini is a Mutable sign**, implying the need for variety and change. You are likely to find that you are easily engaged in new things, seek stimulation and may become easily bored. You are likely to be very adaptable, and love anything new. You may be an instinctive multi-tasker, and may habitually involve yourself in many tasks at the same time. Your need for variety means you are better when doing several things at once, but need to avoid scattering your mental energies so that very little actually gets done.

The essence of this sign is communication. Unless other factors in your birth chart dominate, you are likely to **enjoy sharing information** with others, and may be very talkative. With the Moon in Gemini, may find yourself involved with lots of different people, flitting from group to group, situation to situation, in order to exchange information and ideas. Information is the foundation of your emotional wellbeing. You are likely to feel at your best when actively engaged in learning something new.

For the Moon in Gemini, information is paramount. You may not need to study something in depth to feel that you know enough about it. As long as you have glimpsed the basis of an idea or opinion, you may then feel satisfied to move on. **Like the literal social butterfly,** you may find yourself moving from person to person, gathering data, ideas information or facts before moving on to share what you have gained. You need to know about what is going on around you, and will enjoy imparting to others the information they may need to get through the day.

  
The Moon in Gemini is a very inquisitive placement. In many ways, you experience a sense of personal worth by **connecting to other people**, talking to them about their problems and concerns, and finding out what makes them tick. You are less likely to be concerned with deep emotional intricacies as you are with the peculiarities of their life circumstances or perspectives.

Once you have ascertained where someone is coming from and why, you are likely to then feel compelled to move on to someone else, having satisfied your need to exchange information, so entering another “data file” into your catalogue of human experiences. Your interest in others is indeed genuine.

You may just find you have an almost unquenchable need to know more. In essence, you will need to find a balance between your need for information, and your ability to connect with others on more than superficial terms.


_**Literature is where I go to explore the highest and lowest places in human society and in the human spirit, where I hope to find not absolute truth but the truth of the tale, of the imagination, of the heart. – Salman Rushdie, Moon in Gemini**_

Talking around the surface of things stop them getting heavy. You are likely to have an uncanny ability to turn the conversation around when needed to the brighter side of life. You are probably very good at defining emotions. You have the ability to categorize experiences based on objective fact, but may be less comfortable _actually feeling_ what is happening.

In this sense, you may attempt to avoid deep emotional experiences, feeling more certain of yourself with rational or logical discussion where you can analyze a certain situation, classify it, and move on. In time, you will need to learn to deepen your emotional experiences, so that you can learn why certain emotions occur. Rather than detaching from emotional involvement, you may find that experiencing emotion, then adding logic, helps broaden your social repertoire.
