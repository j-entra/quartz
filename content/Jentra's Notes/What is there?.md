# What is there?
### [[2021-07-16]]: First Encounter
I have no idea how to answer this question, so I'll start by defining each element. 
	What has to be - 
I don't even know where to begin to answer *that*. I'll start off with general concepts that relate to this then: [[Existence]]. It has to exist to be "there." Does "there" mean something apart from one's self? And one's self is identified by [[Consciousness]]. I'm just trying to pull out words and relate them at this moment, because the idea of "what" and "is" and "there" are so obscure. I don't think it's anything related to [[Thought]]. It's something about the [[Nature of Reality]], or [[Physics]], or [[Philosophy of space and time]] (I would put fabric, but I want it to link — although I'm not entirely sure if that concept is related). At this moment, I'm just rambling on about nothing. 
Looking around at my surroundings, there are a lot of different things, each made up of a different element, representing a different concept. There are concepts? There are purposes? There are functions? I see everything in my room has a function at least. From the walls, to art. There is meaning? Is there a reality, or is it all a projection of our own senses? 

[One question I've thought about since childhood](https://www.livescience.com/21275-color-red-blue-scientists.html)is the idea of [[Color]]. Not a novel question, but is color the same for me and you? Now, it's clear that it's not. Colorblind people exist.
I was going to go on a train of thought about if the perception of color is not the same, then how can we even define "there"? How can we assign things, concepts "there" a definition, or seek to find it? I don't think you can ever really define reality, because you'll get down to the [[Atoms]], then down to [[MOC Quantum Physics]], then... I don't know enough about Quantum Physics to say what happens next. In between "there" is, I currently assume, nothing. Inside there is nothing as well, if we really get down to it. Or is "there" the [[Energy]] and [[Vibration]] my New Age books keep talking about? Can everything really be energy? 

That's enough thinking on my own. Time to see where I was wrong.
