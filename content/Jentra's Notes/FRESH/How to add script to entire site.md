Hi Jen - to get this deployed site-wide, you'll first want to:
1. create a javascript file containing the code provided by Alive Chat (however, you will need to remove <script> and </script> from the beginning and end). 
2. You can name this file something like alivechat.js and upload it to your Cascade site then publish it. 
3. Once that is done, follow the instructions in the template wiki to reference the file in your site settings and then publish your site settings.
