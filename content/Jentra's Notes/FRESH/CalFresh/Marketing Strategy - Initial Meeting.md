Questions:
1. Current strategies laid out so far
2. Any strategies put on pause since Malak was gone?
	1. Eat FRESH with CalFRESH â€” Ask me about
3. How are you publicizing to incoming students at SPOP?
	1. CalFresh info sessions, 20+ students RSVP
	2. Promotional Events for Prescreening
		1. List for 0 EFC, workstudy, 
		2. One enrollment for 0 EFC, Workstudy, TANF, etc. 
		3. How were the webinar group sessions? I know I did graphics for those. 
			1. Enrollment Sessions: pretty low
		4. Pre-screening promotional events are just questions right, not actually moving forward
4. Does CalFresh email for re-Cert
5. What is your current partnership with Food Security Commission?

Where do you see peaks in enrollment?
- beginning of each quarter, specifically fall
- fall enrollment sessions most successfully, slow down during winter, spring
- do you know what 
- most successful year was when you had enrollment parties, newsletter, 

Vegan and Pescatartion dietary trend. 


- Incoming Freshman (Celebrate UCI): 


### Boothing
- What tools do you have at the booth?
	- Spin the wheel, prizes 
	- Good idea: snacks
	- Laptop: issues
		- Kiosk so students can sign up 
		- Lead time request for august 

### Enrollment Parties
- Let students know through newsletters 
- Expedited service to your case 
- In person feel (over the phone tech difficulties)
- Snacks: granola, fruit, and water, staff gets lunch 
- How long is it? Basically all day (9-4), cant just walk in (max of 70)
- Attendance count
- How frequent? 
- Two different enrollment parties:
	- Indoors vs. Outdoors (Fair)
- Trying to do twice per

Prescreening, promotional 

### Newsletters

### Social Media
- best option is to have Adrienne handle the creative work, seems like a majority of views come from her strategies 


### Ideas
1. https://github.com/codeforamerica/promptly
	- Or, any other text-based messaging system. Would remind people to sign up for CalFresh (could be email system as well)

2. Refresh the CalFresh Tab 
	1. Eligibility: Farmer's Market section not ADA compliant
	2. Re-Cert: Timeline not ADA compliant
	3. Refresh flyers


----- 
1. First started, pretty slow, 
	1. Boothing every week
		1. Orange Tent
		2. Flyering, ask questions, let people know where we were as a Center

2. Class pitches - virtually
	1. How long are these pitches, do you have a ppt that I can see?
	2. Make powerpoints more accessible and information based (work with Adrienne, Nervana)
3. Person at front desk would pitch CalFresh as well.
4. Pandemic:
	1. Newsletters
	2. Class Pitches

CalFresh appointments are over zoom and in person 
Peer Educator: 21st (FRESH outreach)
