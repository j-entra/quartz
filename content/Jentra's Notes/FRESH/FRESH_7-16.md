## Stand-Up
1. Working on adding Alive Chat to the website in general, currently on the three main pages
	1. OIT asked us if the chat function has been tested for accessibility

> 	**Accessible**: Refers to the concept that people with disabilities are able to access and use a product or system, including with the help of assistive technologies. For example, an “accessible” Web site may be designed so that the text can be enlarged by the user, rather than having a fixed font size, or may be designed so that it can be interpreted and “read out loud” by screen reader software used by blind or low-vision people. 
> 	**Accessible Information Technology: **Information technology that has been designed, developed, or procured to be usable by, and therefore accessible to people with disabilities, including those who use assistive technologies. 
> 	**Assistive Technologies:** Adaptive, rehabilitative devices that promote greater independence for individuals with disabilities by changing how these individuals interact with technology. Examples include special input devices (e.g., head or foot mouse, puffand-sip switches, speech recognition), screen-reading software, and screen magnifiers. 
> 	**UC Location / Location: **Physical sites with a University of California presence, including, but not limited to UC campuses, medical centers and UC managed national labs. Usability: Refers to how easily, effectively, and efficiently users can use a product or system to achieve their goals, and how satisfied they are with the experience.
	
	
2. Website refresh per Karla's Website Review and my own [[Website Review]], as well as building out landing pages for services that don't have it yet such as diaper bank.
3. Creating a [[Website Navigation Guidebook]] specific to FRESH: notice the more that i want to do the more confusing i get as well but I think my successor will be more technologically inclined than me
4. Successors: i think what we have discussed is that my role will be split up into three hybrid roles so one person on [[CalFresh]] specifically, one person on web dev, one person on graphics, etc. 
5. Working on the backlog of tasks
6. Next week drafting up a proposed [[Marketing Strategy - Initial Meeting]]
