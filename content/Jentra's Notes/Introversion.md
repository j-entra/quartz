# Introversion

Refers to [[Idealism]], where there is more emphasis on the subject rather than the object (See also: [[Allegory of the Cave]]). Introverts are reactive, rather than active. The world is not reality, but through the lens of the individual's own perspective. 

### Behaviorism
Barricades themselves from others and forms opinions from a mental distance. Your own opinions are thus regarded as better than anything you could have received from the external world.
