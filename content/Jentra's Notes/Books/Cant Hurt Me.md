- Maybe your limiting factor is that you grew up so supported and comfortable, you never pushed yourself?

- Tell the truth about the real reasons for your limitations and you will turn that negativity, which is real, into jet fuel.

- But when you have no confidence it becomes easy to value other people’s opinions, and I was valuing everyone’s opinion without considering the minds that generated them.

- It was a life devoid of any drive and passion, but I knew if I continued to surrender to my fear and my feelings of inadequacy,

- My task may turn out to be impossible but at least I was back on a motherfucking mission.

- The reason it’s important to push hardest when you want to quit the most is because it helps you callous your mind. It’s the same reason why you have to do your best work when you are the least motivated.

- At the same time, being worn the fuck down is the price of being hard and I knew if I quit, those feelings and thoughts wouldn’t just go away.

- It’s also imperative that you find it because in every failure there is something to be gained, even if it’s only practice for the next test you’ll have to take. Because that next test is coming. That’s a guarantee.

- There is so much pain and suffering involved in physical challenges that it’s the best training to take command of your inner dialogue, and the newfound mental strength and confidence you gain by continuing to push yourself physically will carry over to other aspects in your life. You will realize that if you were underperforming in your physical challenges, there is a good chance you are underperforming at school and work too.

- It means scheduling your life like you’re on a twenty-four-hour mission every single day.

- thirty-five- to forty-mile run. It all added

- But when you persist past that to the point that pain fully saturates the mind, you become single-pointed. The external world zeroes out. Boundaries dissolve and

- you feel connected to yourself, and to all things, in the depth of your soul.

- To exist in this world, we must contend with humiliation, broken dreams, sadness, and loss. That’s just nature.
