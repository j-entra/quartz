# Bayesian Probability
- Used in [[Machine Learning]]. [[Geoffrey Hinton]] believes the brain to be a Bayesian probability machine. 
	- This idea comes from [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]: brains compute and perceive in a probabilistic manner, making predictions and adjusting beliefs based on sensory input. The brain is an inference engine, seeking to minimize "prediction error".
	- Note: Hmm. Seems pretty obvious. Is this what philosophy is like to the outside world?
	- There's some [[Carl Jung]] ideas in here, on the [[Cognitive Functions]]. You have the input, and the processing. The [[Sensation]] and the [[Judgment]] (although it doesn't deal explicitly with predictions).
