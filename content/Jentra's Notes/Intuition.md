# Intuition

Perceives **unconsciously**, sees around and beyond rather than directly, like [[Sensation]]. Concerned with the [[Sixth Sense]] for hidden possibilities and inner meanings. Usually focuses on the general atmosphere. Doesn't reflect reality, but rather creatively adds meaning into the Situation. Easy to draw connections between datasets. In pursuit of the [[Strategic Vision]]. 

# Behaviorism
Gravitates towards the "channeling of pregnant **potential for insight**". (See: [[MOC Astrology]], [[I Ching]], [[MBTI]])
*Author's Note: I find myself justifying the use of Astrology and MBTI as such. I use it in order to find a path for myself or draw out attributes that I would have not otherwise concluded on my own. *

- "subjective images of things which, though not to be met with in the outside world, constitute the contents of the unconscious, and of the [[Collective Unconscious]] in particular." 
- intuition will not "concern itself with external possibilities but **with what the external object has released within him**."

*Warning: can lead to self-delusion and misguided visions. *
