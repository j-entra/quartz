### Sun in Aries 29°  44' 42"

 > The **Sun** in the chart shows our character, personal identity, and ego. It represents our **will to live and our creative life force**. Just as the planets revolve around the Sun in our solar system, we derive our life purpose from the Sun in our natal charts. The Sun is our “adult”– the part of us that censors our “inner child,” reasons things out, and makes final decisions. The Sun also gives clues to our overall vitality. The Sun directs us and can be considered “the boss” of our chart.

When people ask you "What's your sign?", Aries would be your answer. Technically, though, it's your Sun sign that is Aries. Aries is the first sign of the zodiac, and people with the Sun in Aries are the first to start—and the first to finish—whatever they set out to do. They're innovators. Aries is an active, energetic sign. You are likely to be direct, straightforward, and uncomplicated. You expect the same from others, and you're baffled when you don’t always receive the same in return!

The body comes first with Aries and Sun in Aries people are often natural athletes. At the very least, their natural inclination is to use their bodies to get things done. With the Sun in Aries, you are not given to long, drawn-out emotional moments; nor are you big on planning ahead. **Instead, you tend to live your life simply. What is happening right now is most important to you.**

Impatience is a definite vice, and innovation is a tremendous strength. **You very likely love to start anything new, and you have trouble sitting still.** You are a pioneer in many of the things you do, and you possess a fundamental quality of bravery that is unmistakable! Even shy Aries have a deep well of courage to draw from. Aries knows what they want, and they know the quickest route to getting it. You will take shortcuts if you must, but generally what you do is above board. Underhanded just isn't your style. Some Aries people are bold, but even the quieter ones are brave and plucky in their own way. **Independence is your birthright. Nothing gets you going more than a fresh slate, the promise of a new day, and a brand new start. You may not always finish what you start because you enjoy the excitement of innovation,** and you'd be wise to choose a career or hobbies accordingly.

You are a natural leader, but you are also fine with doing things all on your own. This is because gaining followers is not your goal -- you simply want to be first in line. Sometimes others might find you a little brusque or possibly even thoughtless. Often, you automatically assume that others share your enthusiasm, but this quality can lead to others assessing you as insensitive or self-absorbed. **You tend to hate apologies or dwelling on things, preferring to move on and forward without looking back!**

Aries enjoys a challenge, and with your Sun in Aries, you are happiest when your life is active and moving forward. There’s a childlike quality to all Aries Sun people, and it’s often disarmingly charming!

Your Sun sign is modified by various factors, including the aspects it makes to other planets and points, its house position, the house with the sign the Sun rules (Leo) on its cusp, and your Mars sign since Mars is Aries' planetary ruler. These positions add more layers to the Sun in Aries interpretation. Aries is a Cardinal Fire sign. More on [Aries](https://cafeastrology.com/zodiacaries.html).

### Ascendant in Sagittarius 16°  02' 02"

> The **Ascendant** defines, in part, the first impression we make on others in a personal rather than professional sense. It represents our physical appearance, our physical bodies and overall health, and the body ego. It can be the mask or costume we wear to greet the world. It reveals our natural and personal defense mechanisms that we use to adapt to - and cope with - our environment. The Ascendant also shows our first impressions of the world around us and our expectations of same –whether we are naturally hesitant or enthusiastic, for example. How we begin new projects and our attitude towards new experiences come under the rule of the Ascendant.

With your Sagittarius Ascendant, you see the world as filled with adventure, new things to experience, and, most of all, hope. There is an unmistakable faith and enthusiasm with Sagittarius rising people. **Grand schemes, big promises, and a willingness to explore and experiment are themes, although follow-through is not a strong characteristic of this position.** Of course, other factors in your chart can modify this, but taken on its own, Sagittarius Ascendant may at least appear to be a free spirit.

You are enthusiastic, a good sport, and friendly. You are somewhat restless and often active. You always seem to be _looking for_ something that is just out of grasp -- and many people who share this Ascendant with you do this their entire lives. You can be quite direct at times, yet you are likable enough to be forgiven for their faux-pas. You are likely to have a lot to say and offer. Your insights and opinions are usually interesting and exciting, although sometimes lacking in details.

You have opinions about everything, and you just love telling others exactly what they are! Not all people who share this Ascendant with you are outgoing folk, but they all have a way of moving about that at least exudes a certain level of confidence. Some might even call you naive or overly optimistic. Even the quiet ones don't shrink from life and from experience.

You are drawn to or attract talkative, mentally-oriented, and youthful (at least in spirit) partners. While you certainly have a fiery, physical approach to the world, you also place a lot of value on intellectual compatibility. A partner should be adaptable, as you prefer to live your life with options open. Spontaneity is important to you in general and a stubborn or sedentary partner may be difficult for you to handle as a result.

People generally find you approachable and are attracted to your spontaneity and sincerity. Others must learn not to take what you say or how you express yourself too personally - you seek to express the truth, and it's more philosophical than anything, as you have no interest in hurting others' feelings.

You seek answers and share your ideas and beliefs, and you're often one of the first to come up with new thoughts on matters. You can be quite wise and you can usually rise above petty matters. You may thoroughly dislike routine. You may be known for a hearty, infectious laugh and a huge smile. You may have a somewhat disheveled, haphazard appearance.

**You like to keep your options open! You aren't at your best if you're tied down or cooped up.** You are always ready to cheer up others around you. **You're also always learning and growing, or seeking to do so.**

One of the most obvious and endearing traits of this position is your willingness to keep up a sense of humor. Even when you're feeling low, you manage to find humor in life and have fun with whatever you do have. You always seek out inspiration, and you can be very inspiring yourself! You need to feel that there's some meaningful goal to work towards or something better off on the horizon for you, but you can be quite resistant to planning things out.

The placement of Sagittarius' ruling planet, Jupiter, will give more clues to how you go about expressing yourself, how you appear to others, and your first responses and instincts to new situations. Jupiter in Capricorn or in hard aspect to Saturn, for example, might give a more sarcastic approach, but underneath there lies an unmistakable hope and spirit for living. More on [Sagittarius Rising](https://cafeastrology.com/sagittarius_ascendantrisingsign.html).

### Moon in Gemini 27°  01' 23"

> The **Moon** in the signs reveals much about our habits, reactions, and instincts. It shows how we express and deal with our emotions. Most obvious in our homes or in private, our Moon sign reveals our innermost needs. The Moon can represent our experience of nurturing; it also shows how we nurture ourselves! It's important to note that Moon signs change every 2 or 2-1/2 days, and on some days, can be one of two signs, in which case an accurate birth time is necessary.

You were born when the Moon was in Gemini, and this is an important placement in your natal chart. You are pleasant, witty, and charming. People with Moon in Gemini are always interesting people–they have a finger in every pie, are curious to a fault, and are usually well-informed.

Nervousness and worry are common traits with this lunar position. An underlying restlessness is characteristic, and you seem to need more stimulation than others. **You're likely to read a lot, talk a lot, and think** a lot with this airy, mutable position of the Moon (the sign of Gemini belongs to the Air and Mutable families of signs). At home and with family, you can be moody and irritable at times.

Your home may be a perpetual work-in-progress. You generally dislike housework since you prefer to socialize or keep your mind busy, but you can be big on home improvement. Re-organizing your home in little ways seems to keep you happy, as you can be easily bored by both routine and constancy. It's likely that this is a reflection of your inner world -- **"the grass is always greener..."** applies here. You may be more adept at **handling the intellectual needs of others** than emotional ones, although you're competent all around. Complicated emotions, in general, can be difficult for Lunar Geminis to handle, primarily because it takes some time for them to get out of their heads. This doesn't mean that people with the Moon in Gemini are less emotional -- it merely means that they're more comfortable in the world of the mind.

In your family, you may take on the job of organizing get-togethers. You're all for talking things out reasonably. You are at your best when you have plenty of things to do beyond routine.

Moon in Gemini people almost always have a way with words. They are clever and witty, and more often than not can be found chatting with others. **They are sociable and friendly, and they feel comfortable in crowds.** Some pay too much attention to what everyone else is doing and consequently lose touch with what they genuinely want to do. More often than not, **Lunar Geminis have a million and one projects going.** They are impressionable folk, and their imaginations are boundless.

With your Gemini Moon, your **openness to new ideas is admirable, although decisiveness and persistence take a blow as a result.** Still, versatility and adaptability are some of the stronger traits of this position of the Moon.

When irritable, you can quickly become snappy. Your moodiness is complicated. Usually, difficult behavior stems from inner restlessness. As a Lunar Gemini, **you want to do it all, and you can have trouble sticking to any one project. In fact, you often have many projects going at once, and this is satisfying.**

When problems arise, your first instinct is usually to talk things through. Your tendency to analyze can give you the appearance of emotional detachment. In reality, you may be comfortable talking about your feelings, but feeling your own feelings doesn't come as easily! If you don't take time out to really emote and understand your own needs, you could end up baffling others. Feeling misunderstood is common for Moon in Gemini natives until they do get into better touch with their emotions.

You love variety and, in fact, thrive on it. Staying the same holds no appeal to you. You are quick to adapt to changing circumstances, and if situations call for changing plans on the fly, you adjust much more readily than others. You are very often a breath of fresh air.

You are highly observant and bright. People generally love to be around you. Your intelligence, resourcefulness, and wit stand out. You remain youthful and fun throughout life.

### Mercury in Aries  2°  34' 25"

> What's your style of **communication**? How do you make decisions? How do you pick up, process, absorb, and exchange information? These questions are answered, in part, by **Mercury**'s placement by sign in your natal chart. Someone may be an assertive Aries, but they could also have Mercury in Taurus, with a style of communication that's slower, patient, and not quite as spirited as one would expect from an Aries, as an example. Mercury refines the Sun sign, and it helps to define how we take in--and give out--information.

With Mercury in Aries, you make quick decisions--so quick that it may seem as if you don't enjoy thinking things over [[Te]]. The truth is, Aries communicators don't have a lot of patience for mulling. You can be quick and to the point in your communications. You're typically direct and candid, and some may find you crude at times. You may even come across as aggressive but that usually happens when you encounter opposition to your opinions and ideas and is more a result of frustration and impatience. Mercury in Aries people almost childishly assume that others will accept their opinions smoothly. There is a defensiveness to Aries that is distinct. Sensitivity, too. And, when Mercury is placed in the sign, natives tend to be quite personally attached to their ideas.

You tend to prefer streamlined learning and hate to become bogged down in details. **You're adept at dismissing what you feel are irrelevant details!** You usually make quick decisions, and you don't always understand when others hedge issues or stay "on the fence." In fact, you can be extraordinarily impatient with slow responses and beating around the bush.

There's a certain innocent charm to Aries communicators such as yourself. Many people appreciate your utilitarian approach and enjoy that they can pretty much count on you being straightforward. Some may find you a little brusque or too direct.

**This Mercury position favors starting new things.** Aries is not attached to outdated ideas and is enthusiastic, although not necessarily flowery or gushing. Criticism or negative feedback can be taken personally. Still, you're not afraid of a fight or a challenge, on a mental level. You have a **visionary intelligence that is sometimes on the idealistic side.**

New projects and ideas are taken on with an unmatched enthusiasm with this position of Mercury. **However, because there is no shortage of new ideas in life, you can be quick to dump one mental pursuit, way of thinking, or opinion for something fresher and more exciting. You love generating new ideas, plans, and projects, but may not enjoy the follow-up work involved.**

You're excellent at promoting your new ideas. When you're excited about something, your **style of communication can be so motivating and fun, your enthusiasm is downright infectious.** Aries is a leader, quick to adopt absolutely **new and innovative methods--you get a rise out of leading too!** You want to be number one, and since this is communication-ruler Mercury in the sign, it's about the idea, inspiration, and information.

If your Sun Sign is in Pisces or Taurus, you might sometimes wonder why others get frustrated with you. The truth is, your style of communication may lead you to come across as more brusque and impatient than you actually are. 

### Venus in Gemini  9°  00' 48"

> How do you attract things, situations, and people into your life? **Venus** rules our sentiments, what we value, and the pleasure we take in life. Grace, charm, and beauty are all ruled by Venus. Through Venus, we learn about our tastes, preferences, artistic inclinations, and what makes us happy. We look to Venus in the natal chart to see how we approach relationships of the heart, as well as what gives us pleasure. We also turn to Venus to show how we spend our money, the types of gifts we buy, and how much we spend on leisure activities (not to mention the kinds of leisure activities we seek). Venus rules attractiveness--both the ability to attract and attraction to others (and things). Venus rules, amongst other things, the arts, love and romance, beauty and the beautifying process, money, entertainment, leisure, sensuality, and comfort.

With Venus in Gemini, you will attempt to win over the object of your affection with **witty conversation, by displaying just how much you know, and through demonstrating your diverse interests**. You are a playful lover -- some might even call you a tease. You're hard to pin down, and you resist relationships that promise to become too "comfortable." Even if your Sun is in Taurus or Cancer and your outward demeanor may suggest some reserve and caution, you want your relationships to be stimulating and full of conversation with Venus in mutable Air sign, Gemini, the Twins.

You don't want to be too tied or bogged down in your relationships. You appreciate lightheartedness in love. Although you're willing to talk (perhaps endlessly) about the relationship, you may gloss over some of the deeper issues. In love, your tastes change often, and it can be hard for others to know what to expect from one day to the next (or, sometimes, from one hour to the next!).

Pleasing you involves supporting your need **for fun and variety, showing interest in your brainpower and knowledge, entertaining you, and giving you space** for friends and activities outside of the relationship. You appreciate people who make it clear they have loads of fun with you. Partners should try not to become overly miffed by your changeable ways. After all, time spent with you is invariably exciting and invigorating. As well, you are fully capable of settling in with someone who understands your love of conversation, changes of scenery, and variety.

Venus in Gemini Personal Ad Bio: "I am fun-loving. My ideal date consists of going to a cafe, taking in a movie, and talking about it."

You sometimes get involved in relationships solely out of curiosity. **You are intellectually curious about people, and you're eternally fascinated by social interactions.** Although you enjoy flirting, you can remain somewhat **aloof when it comes to matters of the heart.** You are attracted to people who are adaptable, positive, and bright.

Curiosity motivates you on romantic and social levels. **"Variety is the spice of life"** is your attitude in love, in social relationships, and with personal possessions. You're sociable, communicative, and interested. **You can be delightfully animated and fun but may also keep your distance on an emotional level.** Attractions often begin with words, as you tend to bond most readily on a mental level.

You spend money on books, information, and social events. You're a bit fickle when it comes to your attachment to objects and personal possessions, and you seek variety in your personal belongings. You may very well enjoy the thought that goes behind making purchases, weighing various options. You're attracted to art that is **expressive, verbal** and social in tone, light, and happy.

### Mars in Scorpio  5°  44' 19"  Rx

With your Mars in Scorpio, you love to **challenge yourself to do the impossible**. You throw yourself into whatever you decide to do with concentrated energy and impressive willpower.

You can make for a formidable opponent, although often quietly so. You keep your cool and your equilibrium on the surface. Below the surface may be another story, and you are unlikely to let others in easily! You have the potential to exploit others—you see through others, and rely heavily on your gut feelings. Whether you choose to do so depends on different factors in the chart.

You might have a black-or-white philosophy of life. You are the kind of person who says, "Just choose!" You are not comfortable with compromise—what sort of satisfaction could you possibly get from compromise? **X** Real living, to Mars in Scorpio natives like yourself, is all about accepting challenges and making changes.

You regularly test yourself, and, often, others. **Setting rules and goals can often be for the personal satisfaction** that comes from achieving or mastering them. Your survival instincts are strong. You don't usually seek confrontation, but you're not afraid of it, either.

You may have a provocative quality to you at times. This quality is usually most evident in youth, though it is often carried over into adulthood in more subtle, controlled ways. Your tastes are clear and distinct, and you have the ability to stick with people and projects, sometimes through thick and thin. **X** Forgiveness can take time, however. Learning to relax more often is a challenge but can be most beneficial.

Under high stress, Mars in Scorpio can be manipulative and resentful. The tendency to dwell on issues is strong. However, most of the time, you're brave, perceptive, and compassionate. You're unafraid of emotional intensity. You are vastly talented, protective, determined, and willing to go the distance.

### Jupiter in Aries 15°  39' 05"

With Jupiter in Aries, you believe in the **power of positivity--that life is what you make of it.** **You love competition or doing things independently.** You value instant results!

Jupiter in Aries individuals like yourself attract the most **"good fortune" when they take the lead, initiate, inspire others, and demonstrate enthusiasm and courage.** Prosperous areas for you are ones that allow you to head and lead, and to innovate.

As a Fire sign Jupiter, you identify strongly with your opinions, beliefs, and perceptions, and you may take it quite personally if others disagree with them! You make your own opportunities, and you are **at your best when you are thinking in big terms, taking calculated risks, and displaying confidence.**

### Saturn in Taurus  5°  50' 06"

Saturn in our charts shows us where we limit ourselves due to fear or insecurity. With Saturn in Taurus, your fear of not having what you need, of loss, or of **being dependent on others may be more developed than most**, and these things may end up limiting your opportunities if left unattended. Part of you could feel **very guilty when you indulge** yourself, and this can lead to problems, such as **binging-purging cycles**. You might also have a **hard time asking for help**. When you feel insecure or vulnerable, you tend to cling tightly to what you have and know. Sensitive areas of the body may be Taurus-ruled areas, including the neck and throat.

Some of your life lessons include: allowing yourself to enjoy your "winnings" from time to time without feeling guilty or somehow wrong -- in moderation, of course; building the courage to ask for help when you need it without feeling you've failed; going without or giving away something you have, since this helps you teach yourself, in small steps, that you'll be just fine without, and perhaps even stronger; and questioning your loyalty to the familiar if it is no longer serving you well.

### Uranus in Aquarius 16°  23' 00" (7 yrs)

You're most interested in making changes, innovating, and updating traditions related to technology, friendship, community, liberty, individuality, kinship, and fraternity. You seek more freedom in or through these areas, and you don't feel the need to conform--you're ready to rebel if need be. You can feel compelled to break through some of the inhibitions or taboos related to cooperating, connecting, and interacting. Despite the need for progress, you can be very stubborn and set in your ways in these areas. You believe in openness to new ideas and free thought.

### Neptune in Aquarius  4°  17' 31" (14 yrs)

Your vision of an ideal world may center around humanitarianism, celebrating individuality, freedom, and impartiality. You’re invested in humanitarian ideals, and you have a keen interest in electronics, psychology, and social science. When it comes down to it, you prefer to put your faith in humanity, and you’re generally open-minded regarding different philosophical or religious beliefs. Most important to you is for each person to stand out as uniquely individual. This Neptune sign position is more idealistic and theoretical than most others.

### Pluto in Sagittarius 10°  07' 26"  Rx (30 yrs)

You take your beliefs and philosophy of life very seriously, more than most. You believe deeply in personal freedom, tolerance, and bringing cultures together. Uncovering the truth can be a mission. You tend to question beliefs and ideologies in place if you consider them limiting, and your quest to distinguish yourself through--or bring reform to--beliefs is so intense or pressured that you may rarely feel satisfied with your efforts in this area. You may want to watch for a tendency to move from one cause to the next or one project to another, perhaps as a result of this dissatisfaction or from inhuman expectations. However, your faith in humanity is strong, and you are moved and motivated by your positive vision of a better world.

### Chiron in Sagittarius  2°  52' 56"  Rx
https://teaandrosemary.com/chiron-in-sagittarius/

You have an intense craving for **meaning and belief in something greater** than yourself, and you champion free thinkers and encourage others to find their own personal philosophies. You believe in the power of **positive thinking and manifestation**. You help others to find their truths, to follow their inner guide, and to gain life experience. Still, you can often feel somewhat lost on these levels, and while you likely have many brilliant and original ideas about life's meaning and purpose, you might also hold a sense of disconnection with your ideas and beliefs, feeling some insecurity about them. **Learning to trust in your unique vision of the world** is empowering.

### Black Moon Lilith in Scorpio 24°  49' 48"

You may have felt ashamed for the natural need for intimacy, attachment, and depth contact; and you may feel ashamed for the very human feelings of jealousy. You can feel wrong if expressing jealousy or possessiveness and attachment, and you may feel uncomfortable around those who are especially passionate and attached. Learning to accept your very human needs for these things can be empowering.

### North Node in Leo 19°  16' 57"  Rx

> One theory behind the Nodes of the Moon (the North Node and South Node) suggests that we all come into this world with some underdeveloped and overdeveloped aspects of our character. The Nodes of the Moon point us to these specific qualities: the **South Node represents our overdeveloped character traits that we automatically fall back upon.** We're talented here, but if we overdo this area of life or hold onto these traits to feel secure, we may undermine our lives or prevent growth. On the other hand, the North Node suggests the qualities that we need to work on and develop to achieve inner balance.

**With your True North Node of the Moon in Leo, your South Node is in Aquarius.**

A tendency to rely too much on others who may let you down, to **come across as impersonal or distant in your dealings** with others, to be **fearful of being the center of attention and standing out as an individual**, to fear taking risks, and to fall back on peers and community at the expense of your own individuality are some of the issues this position suggests. With this influence, you should watch for falling into the easy trap of worrying too much about what others think about you. **Instead, you need to strike out along your own individual and creative path**. You'd be wise to make a **conscious effort to deal with others in a more personal, involved, and loving manner, rather than falling back on reason and intellect which detaches you from your feelings**. You might unintentionally alienate others when you over-emphasize equality to the point that we won't acknowledge individuals' uniqueness. You may too often be the audience and not the performer in your life! You may too easily lose touch with your own heart by rationalizing your feelings, and you might become **overly involved with other people's problems at the expense of your inner needs for attention**. Learning to take personal risks, which requires a certain amount of self-confidence, will help you to achieve inner balance and happiness.

### Part of Fortune in Libra 18°  45' 21"

You could find that success comes more readily for you when you are fair, impartial, just, and diplomatic. You have an excellent sense (perhaps even a sixth sense) for public tastes. You're also skilled at bringing people together, mediating, harmonizing, improving relationships, and getting to a satisfying balance. In fact, you find joy through these things. Fields that involve art, balance, compromise, luxury, beauty, harmonizing, design, law, negotiation, consulting, and people skills can be most fruitful.

> Look to Libra's ruler, Venus, for more clues to where and how you improve your lot in life.

## Planets and Points in The Houses

### Sun in Fourth House

The Sun's house position modifies and refines its position by zodiac sign. With the Sun in the fourth house of your birth chart, you invest a lot of your pride and energy into your personal and private life, your home, and your family. **Privacy is important to you.** You are naturally protective of your family, including your heritage and personal life. Avoid defensiveness as you work to build a secure foundation for yourself and the people you love. You prioritize your emotions and personal life over more worldly concerns. **You often think way ahead of others when considering the future, however.**

**It can take a lot of energy and gumption to pull you out of your comfort zone. You may take longer than others to feel confident and secure in life, but you do get there! In fact, this position is often associated with people who come into their own and who are exceptionally prosperous in later years. You tend to require a lot of alone, private time and emotional space to regroup and center yourself.**

### Moon in Seventh House

The Moon in the houses can reveal where and how we go about seeking emotional satisfaction. If it's an issue, we can discover vital clues to the reason for perpetual emotional unrest through the study of the house position of the Moon, and these can manifest as constant changes or ups and downs in the areas of life ruled by the house. It is in these areas that we should aim to make deep attachments rather than chase superficial and temporary emotional thrills if we are seeking out a genuine feeling of belonging and emotional fulfillment. It's important to note that house positions are quite sensitive to birth times.

With the Moon in the seventh house of your natal chart, more than usual, you have an emotional need to connect with a partner. You are drawn to partnerships and prefer to have a companion for emotional support. You are not a person who would happily take in a movie by yourself, or dine alone, for example. A partner awakens feelings in you that you may never know you had, and **you seem to need a partner to learn about your own needs and feelings**. More than others, you tend to seek emotional fulfillment through relationships. You seem to **come alive in one-to-one settings**. (true, true)

Whether you connect with one person for a long time or you have multiple relationships, you put a whole lot of emotional energy into your connections. Taking time between relationships is something that may be hard for you to do, but entirely necessary, as you may be afraid of being alone. Knowing that you can be on your own and fulfilled is powerful, and in fact, draws out the best in you.

You are very adaptable to others' needs and quite likable as a result! Be careful that you don't become overly dependent on someone, or assume that a partner is going to treat you the same way as you do them all of the time. Watch for giving more to a partnership too often.

You are an extraordinarily supportive person to the people you care about, you tend to draw emotional or needy people into your life, or you draw out strong emotional responses from others with the Moon in your seventh house of partnerships and "other." You are also a seeker of peace and harmony in your close friendships and partnerships. You will bend over backward to make things right! You're very talented at making others feel comfortable, quickly sensing their needs. You make a good counselor.

### Mercury in Third House

This is an especially **curious and inquisitive** house position for Mercury. You are a quick study! You can be very interested in **reading, teaching, speaking, exchanging ideas**, keeping current with the daily news, and perhaps gossiping. Your interests are many and varied, sometimes to the point that you **barely skim the surface of any one topic**. You can be easily distracted, and your attention span can be quite short, but you're mentally agile. You're an excellent translator or imitator since you're so **acutely attuned to the nuances of language and expression**, and you may be especially good at teaching or otherwise explaining ideas to others.

You enjoy the **challenge and variety of having a number of things going at once**, and you can quickly become bored with routines. This house position is often strong in the charts of people who run a lot of errands or take many short trips. Quick to learn, you are also swift to share what you know with others. You can be very talkative when you have the chance. You very likely are a list maker, and you can be quite involved in your community, or at the least an **avid people watcher who is curious to a fault**. Some with this position are quite nervous or fidgety, perhaps given to pacing, too.

These traits are Mercury in the third house in pure form and can be modified by Mercury's sign and aspects. Strong aspects of Mercury to Saturn or Pluto in your chart, for example, can point to a less chatty and more serious conversationalist and/or to deeper studies and interests, for example. [Note that house positions are highly dependent on birth time.]

NOTE: Since Mercury is very close to the next house cusp, the next item is also relevant.

### Mercury in Fourth House

You are an extremely imaginative person who **dreams up all sorts of unusual ideas and plans**. Your thinking is rather subjective, and in some cases for people with this position (rare ones), **narrow or biased**. For most, though, it's about focus. Some of you might enjoy working at home or keeping a lively, intellectual atmosphere in your home. You more easily than others **retain a lot of information**, and you can be especially interested in history, psychology, or politics. You are not quick to embrace a new idea or plan, and you can be quite traditional in your thinking.

You are often found thinking about your personal life, home, and family! You may worry a little too much about these matters, in fact. Watch for this, as your resting state may be more nervous than for most people. You do tend to nurture and calm yourself with words and lists. You tend to put others at ease about expressing their feelings.

People with this position often enjoy having a **home office or collecting books and other media that aid learning**. Your family life may emphasize education or prioritize learning. These traits are Mercury in the fourth house in pure form and can be, in reality, modified by Mercury's sign and aspects. [Note that house positions are highly dependent on birth time.]

### Venus in Sixth House

With Venus in the sixth house of your natal chart, you are likely **talented at design work**, as you appreciate and pay much attention to all of the little parts that make up a whole, with the goal of finding **order and harmony in these systems**. You enjoy your work and may very well turn a hobby or something you genuinely love into a vocation! You may thoroughly enjoy doing the leg or detail work, and this is one indication that you prefer to work behind the scenes. There can be some good luck involved with finding jobs that you love.

Your expressions of love and affection are practical and helpful. Being of service to a partner is especially important to you. In fact, you might go to great lengths to be available at all costs to a loved one. While you may not be flowery or showy when it comes to expressing love, you show your appreciation through your availability, rendering services, doing practical things for a loved one, and other thoughtful “little” things. You might pass up on real love opportunities in favor of relationships that serve a practical purpose in your life, or out of fear that you might not find better. Selling yourself short may be something that keeps you from going after what and who you want.

### Mars in Eleventh House

With Mars in the 11th house of your natal chart, you like to **organize events and activities, and sometimes take the lead a little too often**! However, for the most part, you're an engaging, helpful friend who is ready to jump in and take action when need be, and this is a wonderful, rare quality. **Your mind needs to be engaged in order for you to be at your most passionate, and for this reason, you can seem a little detached or impersonal in close personal relationships**. You're not afraid to be different or to march to the beat of a different drummer. You're likely to enjoy working towards an important cause, and you can be quite a crusader! You may be attracted to intense, passionate, or energetic people, and your friendships can be quite colorful and possibly strife-ridden at times.

### Jupiter in Fourth House

With Jupiter in your fourth house, you have strong instincts that guide you, particularly on a professional level. You readily make warm connections with others, particularly valuing your family and close loved ones. **Old age is expected to be pleasant and rewarding**. Strong morals were reinforced in your childhood. You dream of--and have a good chance of attaining-- a large or spacious home. You likely feel that **"happiness is home."** You can be a collector of objects of sentimental value, or you take a great interest in history.

Saturn in Fifth House

Uranus in Second House

Neptune in Second House

You prefer not to attach too much value to money, but if this is overdone, there can be quite a few problems in your life concerning money and ownership. You might make money through artistic pursuits, but you should watch for the potential pitfalls of putting too much faith in ideas that don't have enough grounding in reality. In this case, financial advice is imperative to obtain.

You may develop a non-materialistic personal philosophy. This can certainly work well for you, particularly if Neptune is well-supported in your chart. However, it could also lead to impractical attitudes and money problems. When it comes to making money, you tend to act on hunches and intuition. You might have faith that you will come into money one day, or daydream a lot about being wealthy! The trick is to have faith in your own self-worth. If you frequently have money problems, you might want to examine whether you truly are not attached to material things, or if at the root of your personal philosophy, you are actually undervaluing your worth or value.

When Neptune is in good condition in the second house, there can be a sense that you are wealthy no matter what you actually have, and this faith can bring you exactly what you need. If Neptune is challenged, you may be glossing over practical details, and money can too easily slip through your fingers. You might be unusually generous, but avoid situations where you get the short end of the stick financially speaking if they lead to feelings of resentment.

### Pluto in Twelfth House

You are inclined to go deep, to explore the meaning of your dreams, and to **analyze your personal psychology**. You're also quite adept at comprehending others' motives. You may discover that you have healing powers and that you tune in quite quickly to others' struggles and vulnerabilities, understanding more than most. You may become deeply involved when helping others, perhaps even at your own risk at times. **You consider others' backstories and have a strong empathy as a result, with a sense that we're all quite capable of good and evil**. You may, however, keep very many things to yourself, which could eventually impact your health. Ask yourself if some of your secrets are truly necessary, as your first instinct may be to keep things to yourself when a more direct approach would be less complicated. Watch, too, for being your own worst enemy. A perhaps hidden part of you may be seeking a challenge or to push your boundaries, and if not understood and managed, you may jump into troubles impulsively or be the victim of unconscious reactions that undermine you. You might have more unusual, peculiar, or serendipitous experiences in your life than most others as a result of this. This position is sometimes associated with powerful or unexpected enemies. It can also indicate dark, intense dreams--more so for you than most.

North Node in Eighth House

The theory behind the Nodes of the Moon (the North Node and South Node) suggests that we all come into this world with some underdeveloped and overdeveloped aspects of our character. The Nodes of the Moon point us to these specific qualities: the South Node represents our overdeveloped character traits that we automatically fall back upon. We're talented here, but if we overdo this area of life or hold onto these traits to feel secure, we may undermine our lives or prevent growth. On the other hand, the North Node suggests the qualities that we need to work on and develop to achieve inner balance.

With your North Node in the eighth house, your South Node is naturally in the second house.

It's second nature for you to be practical, self-sufficient, and to choose a safe route. Your path, however, is to merge, share, investigate, probe the surface of things, and face deeper emotions--allowing yourself to surrender to the unknown or chaotic from time to time! You may be too superficially involved with certain paths or projects, and you're challenged to dig in. Maintaining the status quo comes naturally to you -- now you're encouraged to grow, expand, and seek more experience. Doing so will improve your life, particularly your finances, many times over.

### Aspects

Sun Sextile Moon (orb 2°43')

With the Sun and Moon in harmony with one another in your natal chart, generally speaking, your emotions and will are at peace with one another, suggesting a reasonably balanced personality. The "messages" you received in childhood were explicit, or at least not contradictory overall, and you have a stronger sense of purpose and appreciation of harmony than most people. You can be personally popular, likely because you _expect_ harmony in your relationships. You are unusually open to relationships, and you're attractive to others. A certain level of self-confidence and a sense of security make you quite easy to deal with on many levels. Your relaxed, easygoing disposition puts others at ease.

Because your expectation of harmony is well-developed, you may not be prepared for conflict, and you might often avoid rocking the boat. In fact, you may often acquiesce, if only to maintain a feeling of balance and harmony. After all, conflict is something you not only dislike, it’s something you may fear. In some ways, you may be too accepting–of yourself and others. You may benefit from questioning life more often, or you run the risk of taking things for granted. Even so, you are prepared to put effort into making things work.

Your vitality is usually good and quite constant. Unless other parts of your chart strongly suggest otherwise, you are not a very hard-driving person, but your constitution is strong. You seem less prone to the kinds of ups and downs that plague those with challenging aspects between the Sun and Moon. This is because your goals and emotional needs are in harmony, despite being different. You have a fantastic ability to understand your limits, and this positively impacts your life in many areas. You are also a brilliant problem-solver.

With Jupiter forming a sextile to Uranus in your birth chart, you have faith in the future, trust your visions, and welcome change and innovation if you expect it will improve your life. New methods and innovations intrigue you. You enjoy being a step ahead of others with your ideas, projects, or knowledge. You also prefer to explore life rather spontaneously. Although you're not averse to some instruction or direction, you want to leave some room for discovery and exploration.

You are quick to imagine possibilities where others see dead ends, and your optimism is commendable. Your sincerity and openness are distinctive. This aspect helps you detach from traditions or customs that feel restrictive. Your ideas, beliefs, worldview, and opinions are somewhat unconventional.
