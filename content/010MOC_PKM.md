consumption workflow
1. backlog
	1. 
2. capture
	1. use [note-symbols](note-symbols.md)
	2. if article: save to reference
3. process
	1. [smart notes](smart-notes.md)
	2. assign ideas into concepts
	3. the prose is NOT in the note
	4. use full and complete sentences, write for a future you.
	5. add in own thoughts related [refraction-thinking](refraction-thinking.md)
	6. tag 25% fleshed notes as #bud
4. produce
	1. at a later time, rewrite for an audience into a short, short essay (as opposed to fast notes). this rewrite should NOT make the concept more complicated to understand. [clear-thinking](clear-thinking.md) use bullet points if you want to.
		1. however, it should be a **beautiful** piece of work that adds value and really captures the reader. that is the purpose of transforming it from a note into an essay. it should read like music, and tell a story like charity water [21-08-01_Su](private/Timestamps/21-08-01_Su.md).
		2. it should have some broader, conceptual meaning. and a call to action to think differently.
