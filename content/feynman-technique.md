- the technique:
1. teach it to a child
- ask: can you explain it to me like I'm twelve?
	
- application -> interviews (if you don't know the answer)
- uncertainty: 
	- grey thinking (gradient of truth)
	- bayesian updating 
		- [bayesian probability](bayesian-probability.md)
		- [elon-musk](elon-musk) [cook and the chef](first-principles-thinking.md#^97494a)
- new information should show said effect increasing
- ask "is this actually the case?"
- don't judge the probability of an event after it has happened
- anecdotes are not data
