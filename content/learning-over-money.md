Chasing money will make you feel insecure and unworthy of your position, afraid to ever make a mistake, to grow. Learning will lead you to the right choices, teach you to get by with less training, finances, and guidance. Learning is an investment that unlike money, can never be taken away.

Counterargument: You can definitely do both.
