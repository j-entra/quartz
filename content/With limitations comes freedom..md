Dantes asks, 
> "What would you not have accomplished if you had been free?” 

The wise Abbe replies, 
> "Possibly nothing at all; *the overflow of my brain would probably, in a state of freedom, have evaporated in a thousand follies.* 
> 
> Captivity brings light to the treasures of the human intellect, just as compression is needed to explode gunpowder. 
> 
> From the collision of clouds electricity is produced; from electricity, lightning; from lightning, illumination." - [[The Count of Monte Cristo]]

The tightly-packed collision of clouds produces intense electricity in the form of lightning; and from lightning comes illumination.

"All are free to choose their thoughts. Some are free to choose their pursuits. And a few so free that they are enslaved in pursuit of their follies." - Nick Milo

This is why it's important to have limitations and rules in creativity. It is only with the limitations of creativity can you bring about masterpieces. Also why I procrastinate. As I mentioned to the [[Foodable]] team as we were discussing accountability, I am fueled by strict deadlines. My best work is done under pressure and stress.
