# Dimonstratzione

>  “commitment to test knowledge through experience, persistence, and a willingness to learn from mistakes.”

**Who is the most independent thinker I know?**
I don't even have a frame of reference. I *can* pull out ideas in my head, but are they really independent, or just different from what I'm used to?

I don't learn from my mistakes. Ever. If I am on the pursuit to self-mastery, is that really a good tactic?

I also do not question conventional wisdom. 

I can articulate my most fundamental beliefs and the reasons I hold them. But not really, because I have no fundamental beliefs right now. 

**What are the most influential experiences of your life?**
1. Winter Retreat on LSD
	1. Daily life
	2. Changed my life for the better, made me appreciate the good in life, chase sunsets and that image for the rest of my life. A newfound appreciation for nature and the beauty of light and reality. 
	3. Opened my mind to listening to music that made me feel more high energy, listening to more podcasts, which led to Jen 2.0.
2. #people/Trinh letting me design the Harry Potter background for her (that's probably how she got into her field, too)
	1. Career path
	2. Lead to my own site, which led to designing in GIMP, which lead to designing for Dragonboat, and the rest is history. Showed me my innate pursuit of creativity.
3. Talking to #people/Steven about my relationship with relationships
	1. Pushed me to Mak. I expressed my concerns, he showed me that I could grow, it will never hurt. Allowed me to make the best choice in my entire college career. I have good food on the table, savings, a loving partner, a loving second family, vacations and experiences I could have never dreamed of, and Snowball. 
4. Joining a Sorority
	1. Pushed me to the extreme so that I could bounce back. Even though I have my regrets, they gave me the standard set of friends. Allowed me to meet people all over the US. Gave me the lifetime experience that I asked for. Made me self-confident and externally validated. Made some great friends to learn from. 
5. Reading Power of Now
	1. [[Public Garden/FRESH/Books/Be Here Now]]
	2. Taught me the importance of being in the present moment, to see the stillness in life. Melted away any anxieties and overthinking loops. Got myself out of my inner world. Pivotal to mental health. 
6. Picking up weed
	1. Rewired my brain and creativity
	2. Although it had it's lows, it allowed me to access my Higher Self. Allowed me to channel new thoughts and make new neural connections that I would have not had before. Enhanced my senses, contributed to my pursuit of surrealism experiences. 
7. Quitting Nicotine
	1. Taught me that I can overcome any difficulties. By starting with the hardest habit to quit, gave me the paradigm shift to understand that I can do anything I wanted to. Gave me confidence in my choices in life. Keystone habit that pushed me to better sleep, better physical health, better pursuit of knowledge. Launched Jen 2.0.
8. Winning Turkey Trot in middle school
	1. Passion for running and endurance. Gave me an outlet and a physical strength — endurance. Put me in the realm of runners, allowed me to understand that I have an innate talent and drive to run. Gave me a stress relief outlet, gave me a another channel to access dopamine — runner's high.
