Why should we learn in public? Shouldn't learning be a purely egocentric pursuit of knowledge? 

We read a little too much and work a little too hard to not retain anything. We should aim to [create more value than we capture](create-not-capture.md) and hope that it may benefit someone else along their journey. 

Learning in public has a few benefits. It allows us to [live beyond your expiration date](expiration-date-legacy.md). If we are afraid of death (or kids), then the act of creation is one way to continue living forever. It serves as a [force multiplier](force-multiplier.md) for learning via [feynman technique.](feynman-technique.md) 

If writing is a powerful tool used for thinking, then writing for the public is an even more powerful tool. 

Other benefits:
- [Show Your Work](books/show-your-work.md) - [Austin Kleon](austin-kleon.md)
- Practice [anti-marketing.](anti-marketing.md)
- Get over my fear of failing by failing.
