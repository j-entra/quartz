- Used in [machine learning](machine-learning.md). [geoffrey hinton](geoffrey-hinton.md) believes the brain to be a Bayesian probability machine. 
	- This idea comes from [Hermann von Helmholtz](Hermann%20von%20Helmholtz.md): brains compute and perceive in a probabilistic manner, making predictions and adjusting beliefs based on sensory input. The brain is an inference engine, seeking to minimize "prediction error".
	- There's some [jung](carl-jung.md) ideas in here, on the [cognitive functions](cognitive-functions.md). You have the input, and the processing. The [sensation](sensation.md) and the [judgment](judgment.md) (although it doesn't deal explicitly with predictions).
