When we think about this or that, we often do it through unconscious filters. Rose-colored, blue, green — these lens cover our perception of an idea. The lens come from our previous limiting beliefs, but refraction thinking involves:
1. shedding these [limiting-beliefs](limiting-beliefs) and 
2. deliberately thinking about an idea through the lens of another idea. 

When we choose our own filters, we come across new connections that we would have never generated organically. 

- example:
	- how does [Design](Design) affect #fitness?
	- both are in pursuit of #on/aesthetic.
	- you are designing your own body
	- appearances ultimately affecting the inside:
		- design affects meaning [the-medium-is-the-message](the-medium-is-the-message) (think [MOC UI/UX](MOC%20UI/UX)).
		- work out for aesthetics enough, and you'll:
			- get strong as well
			- build self confidence
			- improve mental health and energy
	- designing means making deliberate choices.
		- should i move this box 10 pixels up or down?
		- usually,the choices of fitness (and nutrition) are deliberate (because they are hard. it's much easier to unconsciously reach for chips than make a choice to get the healthier option at a restaurant. it always feels like a battle)
- some lens that i think through:
	- [Σ-carl-jung](Σ-carl-jung.md)
	- [first-principles-thinking](first-principles-thinking.md)


- the more you learn, the more lens you have. you can look at one sentence, and see a million meanings.
