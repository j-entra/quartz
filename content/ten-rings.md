- changes to make:
	- gold bracelets should have more weight to them, like they're actually on the arm
	- the dragon tattoo is really hard to distinguish
		- use no pressure, no tapering, thinner line work, no smoothing
	- Background:
		- not sure what to have here 
		- moon festival, water, lanterns (scene from shang chi honoring the dead)
		- https://www.behance.net/gallery/124861281/As-the-dawn-breaks?tracking_source=search_projects_null
	- Lighting:
		- i like the black background the most, but needs an environment
	- Elements:
		- hair?
