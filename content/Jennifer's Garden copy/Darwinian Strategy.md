You can funnel, refine, and define your interest until you hit a narrow niche. You can also combine two unrelated fields to create your own [[Intersection]]. 

Both will allow you to be in a niche with limited competition, meaning that you control your freedom without the need to compete with scarce resources.

Figure out a way to capitalize on this intersection.
