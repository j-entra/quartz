# Systematic Inventive Thinking
- [[40 Inventive Principles]] led to [[Theory of Inventive Problem Solving]], which led to SIT.
- Idea: Think inside the box. 
	- Paradigm Shift: All the building blocks for innovation are right there in front of you, and the solution only requires the reorganization of existing elements. 
- Relates to [[With limitations comes freedom.]], [[Limitation is a catalyst for creativity]].
- Brainstorming needs rules and regulations, a dance between [[Convergent Thinking]] and [[Divergent Thinking]].
	- Article also relates it to [[Parkinson's Law]]: ideas expand to fit the box that is provided. Much quicker to limit the scope of possibilities, saving time and energy. Goes against the idea of [[Creativity]], a little. (If I tried hard enough, I'd probably be able to combine the two thought processes.) 

### The Innovation Equation
1. Subtraction
	1. iPhone gets rid of headphone jack -> paves way for Airpod Pros
2. Multiplication
	1. Multiple # of pixels -> Retina Screens
3. Division
	1. Laptop -> tablet
4. Task unification
	1. Alexa listens to you, you listen to it + (added bonus: smart homes, all in one home management system)
5. Attribute Dependency
	1. Break them or create new intentional dependencies
	2. Transition glasses: dark -> glasses; light -> sunglasses
