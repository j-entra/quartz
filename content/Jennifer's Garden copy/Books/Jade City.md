- Summer had barely begun and already the city of Janloon was like a spent loverâ€”sticky and fragrant.

- Far out on the water, the slowly traveling lights of shipping vessels were smeared into blotches by sea fog and the haze of pollution from the city.

- The air was warm and heavy with fumes, the sweetness of overripe fruit, and the stink of nine hundred thousand perspiring inhabitants.

- Shae was struck by a sense of nostalgia so profound she found it difficult to breathe.
