# Extroversion

An association with the objective situation rather than the subjective standpoint. (See also: [[Be Here Now]] or [[Power of Now]]). Active and rapid in reaction, rather than hesitation. 

### Behaviorism
Is in an engaged state with all areas of life. [[Morals]] are not self-imposed, but rather go along with the societal standards (On the other hand, [[Introversion]] can lead to self-delusion).
