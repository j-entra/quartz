# Extroverted [[Sensation]] (Se) - "Sensation"

Allows me to appreciate the intense present. Heightened sensory [[Need to create immersive Experiences]]. Music and sound, nature, crowds, exploring dangerous situations, to enhance it all are what I seek in life.

### Documentation 
- While TeNi’s are great with abstract ideas, concepts, and conversations, they will see even more value for ideas when they can find a way to bring it out into the world and make it a tangible reality.

- While endless speculation about every possibility under the sun is fun, TeNi’s are very action-oriented people and they will be itching to do something to see all their ideas play out in the real world. Because their inner world is more abstract, they seek their stability in the world around them.

- When it comes to getting to know people, TeNi’s often prefer doing things with people to spending hours talking as a means of getting acquainted. They crave thrill and adventure. **They enjoy being engaged with the world around them. ** [[21-07-18_Su]] < Clubbing Experience

- Exploring nature, getting involved in physical sports, or getting their hands dirty and doing things in the physical world is very cathartic for them. Their surroundings have a strong influence on them, and they can be very aware of their physical environment.
	
- When a TeNi does something to engage their senses, this can be a source of energy. Without risky, fun, ‘5 senses’ types of experiences, their energy and creativity flatlines and they may turn to **unhealthy vices like binging** on food, alcohol, television, or video games to try to fill this need for physical engagement. This need is better filled with exercise, exploration, and play.
	
- Their internal world has a certain intensity to it that they may feel is lost once it’s brought out through verbal communication. **They tend to be more at ease communicating through images, sound, written word, or some other form of expression where they are able to explore the full depth of an idea and expand on it before presenting it to public scrutiny. They are also usually more interested in finding the meaning behind things** than taking them at face value, which means they may take some time to process new opportunities or unusual circumstances they find themselves in.
