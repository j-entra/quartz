His website is... pretty amazing. I'm not a huge fan of the scrolling gallery portfolio layout (hard to navigate and understand, a little overwhelming at times). But his is clear, laid out like a [[Apple]]-esque newspaper article (but with GIFs, like [[Harry Potter]]). I'm a sucker for [[Interactive Exploration]]. He talks about [[Generative Design]], which imagines a world where you can "create narratives, designs, and brand experiences that are flexible, reactive, alive and breathing".

This guy is great with words. And visualization.
