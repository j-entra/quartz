# Review of designers:

1.  Phillip: I believe he was the one with webdev knowledge, but actually has the best graphic design skills as well (ui/ux principles, good for social media graphics)
2.  Brandon: strong motion design skills, top pick for video production.
3.  Suzanne: strong understanding of balance between simplicity and creativity
4.  Angelyn: good creative eye but samples don't have graphic design work (more illustration based)

My recommendation:
1. Phillip on **web development** AND **design** (if he has the bandwidth and wants to do design)
2. Brandon on **video editing/motion design** as needed. Video editing is more intensive, so I would have him specialize in it (list potential upcoming projects, longer timelines) rather than spreading him too thin on graphic design, ops, and videos. (But has second best graphic design skills).
3. Suzanne and Angelyn on Graphic Design. Samples show more graphic illustration vs. design, but with training workshops it'll be easy to learn graphic design principles.
	1. Suzanne has more relevant skill (as of now), so I would recommend Suzanne takes on more key projects, and Angelyn offloads some of the work. 


Note: My top recommendation is a little different from what we had discussed at our previous 1:1. 
Instead, have Phillip and Brandon handle graphic design + respective fields only (no Operations). Phillip would also handle website management. If I'm looking at the right Philip on Linkedin, he's a CS major and this experience would allow him to have more relevant/tangential growth in his professional development. (Can't find Brandon on Linkedin).

Suzanne and Angelyn would work in operations mostly, and work on minor, quicker design tasks as needed (Like Jenning, Kim, etc). but still attend a Design Workshop and FRESH Brand training.
