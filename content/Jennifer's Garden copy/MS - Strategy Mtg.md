# Strategy
### Digital
1. **Email**
	1. Targeted Email Outreach
	2. Incredibly effective as long as it's personable and targeted. 
	3. I'd like to prepare them with provided content
2. **Social Media**
	1. Adrienne: 
		1. Really good for growth (have her work on Reels, graphics might be too time-intensive with low pay-off)
	2. Instagram
		1. Update SNAP-Ed Highlights
		2. Brandon works on IG TV/Reels
	3. Facebook
3. **Website**
4. Pre-Screening Quiz
	1. Graphic directing them to link in bio, also embed Typeform into website
	2. Essentially Typeform
	3. Are you eligible for Free Groceries? Take our free quiz.
	4. There, we'll be able to collect data on who drops out at which moment. That's a painpoint, and we can pivot our content to address that concern. 
	5. Once they finish the quiz, they can get an email
	6. Re-vamp to encourage an easy process

### On-Campus
1. Ring Road
2. Classrooms
3. ASUCI Food Security Partnership
	1. They'll be able to get our message out to social media channels, as well on the big billboard in Student Terrance

### Pantry
1. Eat Fresh with CalFresh shirts
2. Train student staff on CalFresh redirection


### Off-Campus
1. Student housing events
	1. RA's/CA's host events weekly. Some workshops are about budgeting, food prep, etc. By bringing the experience directly to their home. Assuming majority of students stop classes after 5pm (figure out time workshops are usually held, and if they have high average attendance.)
		1. Incentive: Food
		2. Model best fits PV (not sure how accessible other Community Rooms are)
		3. Addresses: Time Commitment


## Content Plan
- Produce weekly content according to the 4 pain points:
	- Myths
		- For the people who still have a stigma
	- Tips and Tactics
		- Very broad, includes recurring guides centered around food  (meal-prep, 
		- For the people interested, but don't understand the pay-off to transition to CalFresh
		- 
	- Simpl
- Ease of Use (EBT)
1. Ease of application
2. Busy Schedule
