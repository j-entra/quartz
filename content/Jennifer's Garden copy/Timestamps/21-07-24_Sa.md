## Morning Startup

### [[Gratitudes]]
> Janine, for helping me with scheduling Philip's shift

### [[Accomplishments]]
1. Finished the marketing plan day of
2. Didn't go out to buy anything, and actually had a wonderful meal of frozen tofu.
3. Had a pretty fun afternoon work session
4. Installed the cable management
5. Didn't smoke, although I was tempted to.

### [[Lessons Learned]]
1. Even though you ate late at night, you still woke up pretty hungry early. I think you get hungry based on the amount of distraction in your work life, and the amount of stress you feel. Just, work first and then eat.
