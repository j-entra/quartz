## Pages
- went to westminster to help mak shop, didn't find anything
	- westminster mall is surreal, empty â€” gave me abandoned mall vibes. the target was two stories, but the first floor was uncomfortably warm.
- smoked the color's vape, watched loki, went shopping and spent $88 on groceries
- a big bundle of carrots was only 3 bucks. pretty good. didn't get it, though.
