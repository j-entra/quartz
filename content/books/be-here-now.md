- To become free of attachment means to break the link identifying you with your desires. The desires continue; they are part of the dance of nature. But a renunciate no longer thinks that he is his desires.

- As many times as you trip and fall, i.e., give in to a desire—just get up.

- think upon pouring God into God, if you know what I mean.

- Everyone you meet is Ram who has come to teach you something. You are continually meeting and merging into perfection.

- In order to perform karma yoga, there is a simple general principle to keep in mind: bring a third component into every action. If, for example, you are digging a ditch, there is you who is digging the ditch, and the ditch which is being dug. Now add a third focus: say, a disinterested person who is seeing you dig the ditch. Now run the entire action through his head while you are digging. It’s as simple as that.
