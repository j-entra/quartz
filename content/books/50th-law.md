1. What you really value in life is ownership, not money. Ownership of your time. "Carve out little empires", move up.
2. Instead of thinking of life as chance encounters, think that everything that has crossed your path a vessel for power and expansion. 
3. sometimes, you'll rise to the occasion. why not make the occasion yourself?
4. make the most of what you have
5. try to solve the problems yourself "don't show anything that you wouldn't be proud of"
6. look for turning points 
7. move before you are ready
8. keep moving—calculated momentum
	1. move with the chaos, don't give people the chance to pin you down to one thing, keep moving and change your appearances to fit the environment
	2. if anyone wants to keep creating they have to be about change
	3. forgetting is a skill needed for emotional flow -- do not hold onto emotions
	4. you hae nothing to fear from moments of transition
