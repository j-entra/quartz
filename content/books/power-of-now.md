- It is not a trancelike state. Not at all. There is no loss of consciousness here. The opposite is the case. If the price of peace were a lowering of your consciousness, and the price of stillness a lack of vitality and alertness, then they would not be worth having.

- you are much more alert, more awake than in the mind-identified state.

- Just become intensely conscious of the present moment.

- highly alert and aware but not thinking. This is the essence of meditation.

- This means that you no longer take the content of your mind all that seriously, as your sense of self does not depend on it.

- Because you are identified with it, which means that you derive your sense of self from the content and activity of your mind.

- To complain is always non-acceptance of what is.

- Is your goal taking up so much of your attention that you reduce the present moment to a means to an end?

- Is it taking the joy out of your doing? Are you waiting to start living?

- in the end you will always have to return to the body, where the essential work of transformation takes place. Transformation is through the body, not away from it.

- Forgiveness is to offer no resistance to life - to allow life to live through you. The alternatives are pain and suffering,

- The moment you truly forgive, you have reclaimed your power from the mind.

- 'Accept whatever comes to you woven in the pattern of your destiny, for what could more aptly fit your needs?"

- have learned to offer no resistance to what is; I have learned to allow the present moment to be and to accept the impermanent nature of all things and conditions. Thus have I found peace.
