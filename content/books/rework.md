1. Ignore the real world
2. Failure is not a rite of passage or a prerequisite for success.
	1. Other peoples failures are other people's failures. It has nothing to do with you.
	2. On failing: What do you really learn from mistakes? You learn what *not* to do, but not what you *should* do. 
	3. Evolution doesn't care about failures. It only cares about what has worked.
3. Planning is guessing. Make sure you have the option to pivot. 
	1. [antifragile](antifragile.md)
	2. Give up on the guesswork. Just figure out the week. It's okay to wing it, as long as it follows reality. 
4. Why grow?
	1. Staying small means you'll be more agile and flexible. 
5. Workaholism
	1. Don't. More effort does not equal more reward. [antifragile](antifragile.md)
	2. Also, take care of your body to make better decisions. Stay sharp.
6. Make a dent in the universe
	1. If you're going to do something, do something that matters. You don't have forever. 
	2. Note: Don't agree. 
7. Scratch your own itch (solve your own problem)
	1. Make something you want to use, and you'll figure out if what you're making is any good.
