- You have one glorious and brief shot at being the you that is you on Planet Earth, and the power to create whatever reality you desire. Why not be the biggest, happiest, most generous, and fully realized humanoid you can be?

- I make making money fun.

- Via your intuition: I just know in my gut that I should buy this house even though it costs way more than what I wanted to spend. It still feels right. Via synchronicity: I wonder what ever happened to Janet from cooking class. Oh look, there she is, calling me right now. Via inspiration: Check out this awesome idea for a song that just popped into my head out of nowhere! Via desire: I just know I’m meant to be rich even though none of my screenplays have sold yet. Via coincidence: I just opened a book to the perfect page—it’s exactly what I needed to read! If you are truly committed to kicking ass, you’ll want to strengthen your relationship with the Universe in the following ways: Learn to quiet your mind and receive the information it’s trying to send you. Trust that this information (aka your intuition) provides all the answers you’re seeking no matter how terrifying/bananas/unacceptable they may seem. Surrender and have faith that when you bravely head into the unknown, the Universe has your back. Accept that you don’t have to know how to do what you don’t know how to do yet, and that the Universe will lead the way.

- Fall madly in love with your purpose for making money and you will be unstoppable.

- In order to become the new, richer you, you must relinquish your attachment to your present/old identity.
