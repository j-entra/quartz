# Although we don't all see the same colors, our perceptions of the wavelengths are tied to universal emotional responses.

Organisms prefer to photosynthesize during sunrise and sunset. We rise with the yellow rays of sun in the morning, and grow tired as the night fades. [[Melanopsin]] regulates [[sleep]], absorbs short-wavelength (blue) light to regulate the central [[Body Clock]]. Note the memory of [[lsd]].

I think this would be two separate ideas. And the subtext doesn't quite relate either. 

[[Blue-yellow Visual System]]
