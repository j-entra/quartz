## Better Resourc

## Where do I get started?
### Tools:
1. ### Any analog writing tool (optional):
	1. I process notes by **handwriting** them. Why?
		1. If I process them directly in Obsidian (that is, by typing), I have a tendency to copy exactly what the author has written. By handwriting, I'm forced to distill information in a concise, direct manner. (See: [save what speaks)](save-what-speaks.md)
			1. *?? What information is actually useful to me right now?*
		2. Note: The point of PKM as a system is to serve as a Second Brain where you don't have to store information in your mind, but I find that it's useful practice for natural connections.
2. #### Any bi-directional notetaking platform
	1. **Notion**: too clunky
	2. **Roam Research**: out of my budget
	3. **Obsidian:**
		1. Obsidian works on markdown files (text files), which means that your notes are your notes â€“ they aren't hosted on an external platform. 
		2. It has a lot of customization in workflow and style (community plug-ins, css themes) if you want that freedom.
		3. free and fast
3. #### Some guides, templates, inspiration
	1. [Linking Your Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC85D7ERwhke7wVqskV_DZUA)
		1. I based my garden off the LYT Kit. Recommended if you don't have a clear concept of how to organize your notes.
	2. [Moby Diction](https://publish.obsidian.md/mobydiction/notes/_About)
	3. [The Refined Mind (Mike)](https://refinedmind.co/)
	4. [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden)
		1. good garden formatting (cards)
	5. [Daily Questions Tracker](https://thesweetsetup.com/journaling-using-daily-questions-in-obsidian/)

4. #### A way to publish your notes.
	1. the "public" in [learn in public.](learn-in-public.md) Choose your method based on your wants and needs.
		1. **Obisidan** ($8/month plan): useful if you want to effortlessly publish your notes.
		2. **Quartz** (free): What I currently use. Why? I have little experience in coding, and wanted to learn. Also, free. Hosted on Hugo.
	2. Note: This is optional. Have a Second Brain privately for a while before deciding to work with the garage door up.
