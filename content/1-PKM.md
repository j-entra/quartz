## consumption workflow
1. **backlog**
	1. [now](now.md) | [how to read a book](books/how-to-read-a-book.md)
	2. we do not have to finish anything. if it's irrelevant to us, skip and move on. we should prioritize and digest content with a purpose by setting an end goal or a question when taking in new information. always challenge the writing from [first principles.](first-principles-thinking.md)

2. **capture**
	1. use [note symbols](note-symbols.md)
	2. [save what speaks](save-what-speaks.md)
	3. if article: save to reference
3. **process in [digital garden](digital-garden.md)**
	1. [smart notes](smart-notes.md)
	2. assign ideas into concepts
	3. the prose is **NOT** in the note
	4. use full and complete sentences, write for a future you.
	5. add in own thoughts via [refraction thinking](refraction-thinking.md)
	6. tag notes: still figuring out system
		1. tag ideas as #atom tho
4. **produce**
	1. at a later time, rewrite for an audience into a short, short essay (as opposed to fast notes). this rewrite should NOT make the concept more complicated to understand. [clear thinking](clear-thinking.md) use bullet points if you want to.
		1. however, it should be a **beautiful** piece of work that adds value and really captures the reader. that is the purpose of transforming it from a note into an essay. it should read like music, and tell a story.
		2. it should have some broader, conceptual meaning. and a call to action to think differently about something.
